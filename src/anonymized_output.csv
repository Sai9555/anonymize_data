2,"Once upon a time, there was a young boy named NAME who lived in a small village at the foot of a mountain. Despite his poverty, NAME was a happy child and had a big dream of DATE discovering the treasure that was said to be hidden in the mountain.

DATE, while exploring the forest near his village, NAME stumbled upon a magic beans that a strange old man was willing to trade for his only possession, his trusty cow. Not realizing the true value of the cow, NAME made the trade and took the beans home.

That night, NAME planted the beans and as he fell asleep, a giant beanstalk sprouted from the ground and reached the clouds. Excited by the adventure that lay ahead, NAME climbed the beanstalk and discovered a magical kingdom ruled by a fearsome giant.

Determined to find the treasure and make his fortune, NAME snuck into the giant's castle and found the treasure chest, filled with gold and diamonds. But as he was about to leave, the giant woke up and caught NAME.

14,"Other skaters were speeding after Step: but NAME, turning, hurried to the heap of boards near the fire. He caught up the longest plank on which he could lay hands, and skated down the pond with all the speed his burden[171] permitted. Before him other would-be rescuers, halted by the widening circle of open water, were moving about aimlessly, if pluckily, getting in one another’s way, and risking a general break-up of the ice under their weight. One youth, indeed, had slipped over the edge, but luckily had been dragged back, suffering no more serious consequences than a drenching to the waist.

Orkney was clutching desperately with one hand at the crumbling edge of the ice. At first NAME saw nothing of NAME, but as he dropped his board and thrust its end over the water, he had a glimpse of the boy’s head, pressed close to Orkney’s breast. So NAME, having caused the disaster, was doing what he could to save an innocent victim! Such was NAME’s belief, and the belief of Step and the rest.

The long plank swung nearer and nearer to Orkney. He grasped it, drew himself forward, threw an arm over it; his other arm was still about NAME. NAME, kneeling on the board with Step anchoring its end to the thicker ice, got a firm grip on Orkney’s coat collar. Then came the tug of war. It NAME] for thrilling seconds, of which NAME was to have only confused memories, in which were mingled the ominous cracking of the ice, the shouting of the spectators, his own cries of warning to the crowd to move back, ORGANIZATION’s struggles, the ghastly pallor of ORGANIZATION face. Slowly, by inches, they gained. Then with a report as sharp as that of a pistol a foot or two of the edge gave way; ORGANIZATION dropped back till his shoulders were submerged; NAME’s arms were plunged in water to the elbows. Then NAME made a mighty effort. NAME exerted all his strength. What had been lost was recovered and retained. Then there was another clear gain; and, in an instant more, Orkney and NAME had been dragged to safety.

NAME was able to raise himself on an elbow, but NAME lay unconscious and motionless."
15,"The junior class of ORGANIZATION probably was neither much better nor much worse than the classes which had preceded it, and the other classes which were following it, along the paths of knowledge. It had its bright boys and girls and its dullards; its examples of industry and of idleness; its workers and its shirkers; its happy-go-lucky members, who made the most of DATE without thought of the DATE, and its budding politicians, who laid wires and pulled them with an eye to future advantage. Perhaps the most distinguishing peculiarity of the class, however, was the influence exerted by a group of boys, with some of whom we have become acquainted.

Just why ORGANIZATION (lately the ORGANIZATION) should have been so potent a factor was not easily explained. The faculty, which had suspicion rather than understanding[97] of the fact, did not try to explain it, while certain ambitious youths, not of the charmed circle, insisted that it could not be made clear. The club did not include the coming valedictorian or salutatorian; it had none of the most distinguished athletes; yet the truth remained that its backing was a prime necessity to secure success in any class undertaking. If there were a fund to be raised for the ball team, or if a picnic were planned or a DATE jollification, wise promoters at once sought the endorsement of the club. As it usually was given in generous measure, there was little general criticism of the coterie, though, as was inevitable, there were envious ones who lost no opportunity privately to say unpleasant things about the members, singly and collectively.

In this, of course, jealousy figured. Several of the boys deeply resented the failure of the club to invite them to become members; and the feeling was bitterest in the case of one NAME.

Now and then one comes upon a striking example of the square peg in the round hole. Orkney did not fit. He was comparatively ORGANIZATION] new boy in ORGANIZATION, having lived there but DATE, and having come with some very firmly established notions of his own importance. At bottom he had his virtues—plenty of them, no doubt; but they were overlaid and concealed by a highly unfortunate manner. His early study had been under tutors, who had helped him to better knowledge of his text-books than to preparation for what may be called the rough-and-tumble experiences of recitations in a large class. If he blundered, and the division laughed, that was DATE in his calendar; and he scowled and sulked, and cherished a grudge against those who had led in the merriment. Worst of all, he often found means to settle these scores, and so had contrived to make himself exceedingly unpopular among his classmates; though, as it happened, he also drew to himself a few supporters and adherents from among the discontented element, which is so frequently to be observed in any organization.

While it could not be said that the juniors were sharply divided into factions, it was certainly true that the relations of the club and[99] of the Orkney “crowd” were strained. Recently there had been two or three incidents, trifling in themselves, but together doing a good deal to increase the rivalry.

Oddly enough, ORGANIZATION, one of the most peaceful of mortals, had succeeded in enraging Orkney. Step, as a rule, was no shining star of scholarship; but by some mental twist he was a very planet in ORGANIZATION. In Latin he was merely fair, and in French not quite so good, while the less said of his algebra and geometry the better; but, in the speech of his friends, he took to Greek as a duck takes to water. Poke Green accused him of “reading ahead” in Xenophon for the fun of the thing; and declined to withdraw the charge in spite of his almost tearful denials, holding, indeed, that it was confirmed by Step’s success in translating a “sight” passage, which NAME had stumbled over. Poke forgot all about the episode in an hour, but NAME added another to his growing list of grievances against the club. His average for the term was far above Step’s, but he begrudged the lanky youth even a trifling triumph. And then came the matter of NAME."
16,"Now, however, there was only a chalky smear to show where the lines had been. “What are you doing?” he repeated. “Say, you’ve spoiled it!”

“Huh! This club needs a new name,” growled Poke. “I’m trying to think of one that’ll fit.”

NAME wheeled and addressed the youth in the chair. “Step, what ails him? What ails you? What’s the matter, anyway?”

Step clasped his hands about his knees. “What ails us? Guess you wouldn’t be asking if you knew!”

“Course I wouldn’t!” NAME agreed rather testily to what might be called a fairly self-evident proposition.

“Hang the luck!” groaned the doleful Step.

Poke whipped about. “Confound it, but[52] there’s more than luck!” he cried. “You’re letting us off too easy, Step. Oh, I know—I know what you’d say! We didn’t mean to have it happen, but it did happen; so what’s the use in talking? And it was just like a lot of other things that keep happening to us, and will keep on happening till we have more sense.”

“Huh!” came from the depths of the chair.

NAME dropped a hand on ORGANIZATION’s shoulder. “Translate, won’t you? You’re worse than old NAME when he tells about building his bridge.”

“Darn that dog!” wailed Step.

NAME tightened his grip on ORGANIZATION’s plump shoulder. “So there was a dog, was there?” said he. “That’s a start, anyway. Go on!”

Poke wriggled free. “Yes; there was a dog, and it was that big hound of Mr. NAME’s. And it came along, and smelled Step’s chicken, and grabbed for it, and gobbled it, and knocked over my basket of eggs, and ran away. And we chased it, but couldn’t catch it. And Step lost his chicken, and every one of my eggs was smashed. And ain’t that trouble enough for DATE?”

[53]

“But I don’t quite understand. It—it’s sort of complicated. I don’t see how the hound could grab the chicken and upset your basket all at once.”

Poke shifted weight from one foot to the other. “Well—well, you see, we—we’d sort of stopped to look at a knife NAME had bought; and we’d set the bundle and the basket on a stone wall; and the dog hit both when he jumped for one. That was the way of it. And say! did you ever hear of anything worse?”

NAME’s smile was bitter. “Anything worse!” he repeated scornfully. What was a poor tale of broken eggs and looted chicken to one who, by pure mischance, had shot a man?

Poke resented his friend’s tone. “Huh! Much you know about it! Dollar and ten cents’ worth of eggs gone—just like that!”

“And a five-and-a-half-pound rooster—DATE half pounds dressed!” chimed in Step.

“Oh, well, that was hard luck,” NAME admitted. It had occurred to him that it was not wise to withhold sympathy if he would avoid suspicion of cherishing some terrible secret of his own.

[54]

Poke was one of those ordinarily cheery souls who, on occasion, take melancholy consolation in contemplation of misfortunes.

“I’ve been thinking things over,” he declared. “I’ve got an idea. It isn’t the thing itself that bothers, but the consequences. Look here, now! NAME had promised to make two angel cakes—takes eleven eggs for each cake. And she’d promised one for the church supper, and NAME was to have the other for her club. And now NAME has got to disappoint the supper committee, and they’d told her they set ’special store by her angel cake. And she’s hot! And NAME—say, NAME, if you had a sister, you’d know the fix I’m in. NAME’s just sizzling. So I’m keeping away from the house. Gee, I’d never go home if I could help myself!”

Step waved a long and pitiful hand. “Company for dinner to-DATE!” he said simply. “I’m lying low myself.”

NAME meditated briefly. Since that terrible moment on the ridge he had gone through half a dozen phases of emotion. He had ranged from terror to exultation. His plans had varied from full confession to absolute[55] silence. Now he was disposed to follow a course of inaction, based on a belief that the man had not been badly hurt, and that perhaps nothing ever would be heard of the affair. Of course, if report should be made; or if it should prove that the wounds were serious; or if the victim should turn out to be a poor man unable to pay a doctor’s bill—well, he wouldn’t cross bridges till he came to them. And, meanwhile, he would try to bear himself as if nothing untoward had happened—and thank his lucky stars that he could keep his secret, even for a time.

“Well, that was hard luck!” he said again, and put more heart in the speech.

Poke returned to the blackboard. “Might as well learn a lesson when there’s a lesson to be learned,” he rumbled. “Struck me, too, we ought to post something here to remind us that it pays to keep out of trouble. I’d like to give the club a name that’d mean something—see? I can think of mottoes enough—‘Look before you leap, and then go ’round,’ and ‘You never can tell when it’s loaded,’ and a lot of others—but I’m stumped for a name. Now, if I——”

[56]

There he broke off. NAME, elbowing him out of the way, stood before the board. For a second young NAME hesitated. Then he caught up a piece of chalk, and scrawled in big letters:

ORGANIZATION.

Poke clapped his hands. “Jiminy! but that’s just the idea I was groping for. Prime, ain’t it, Step?”

Step nodded gloomily. “Fa-fair,” he admitted.

NAME laid down his chalk. He dusted his hands a trifle theatrically.

“Like the name, do you?” said he. “Came to me all of a sudden.”

“It’s a crackerjack!” declared Poke warmly. “Hits the nail right on the head. But that makes me think, NAME—where’s that deer you were going to hit? Haven’t got that haunch in your pocket, have you?”

“No,” said NAME curtly.

“Bet you didn’t see a deer!”

“I—I didn’t.”

Poke was beginning to recover his spirits. “Huh! Knew you wouldn’t,” said he, and[57] chuckled fatly. “This country’s hunted to death. Why, so many men with guns were out to-day that one of ’em had to let drive at another, just for something to shoot at.”

“What!” gasped NAME. “What’s that? What do you mean?”

“Just what I say.”

NAME pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped drops of cold sweat from his forehead. “But—but——” he faltered.

“It isn’t a case of ‘but’ or ‘if.’ Step there knows all about it. He saw them bringing him in.”

NAME’s brain was reeling. “Bring-bringing him in?” he quavered. “Then—then he was badly hurt, after all! And who—who was he?”

Poke was staring in bewildered fashion at NAME. “What’s upsetting you? Why, you’re white as a sheet!”

“Never mind me! Who—who was it?”

“NAME.”

“Pe-Peter Groche? And—and he—he’s wounded—maybe dying?”

Poke laughed explosively. “Not he! Old rascal was never born to be shot.”

[58]

“But you said they—they were bringing him in?”

“Yes—to the lock-up!”

NAME dropped into the nearest chair. “I don’t—don’t under-understand,” he said weakly.

“It’s clear enough. NAME shot somebody else—or tried to.”

Step joined in the conversation. “Well, he did wing him,” was his contribution.

“Where?”

“Oh, grazed his head, and plunked him in one hand,” said Step.

NAME dug his finger-nails into his palms. “I don’t mean that—at least, that wasn’t what I tried to ask about. Where did the shooting take place?”

“Out beyond Marlow hill somewhere. But you steered that way, didn’t you?”

“In that general direction.” By a mighty effort NAME controlled his voice.

“Then you may have been within a half mile of NAME,” Step went on. “Maybe you heard his gun. Well, if you didn’t, he fired it, anyway. And he ’most got his man for keeps. But the Major wasn’t hurt badly,[59] and he had had a glimpse of NAME DATE, and knew about where he was. So he beat it through the woods after him, and overtook him near the back road. And just then, by luck, along came ORGANIZATION. So the sheriff and the Major asked Mr. NAME a question or two; and, getting no satisfaction, loaded him in the ORGANIZATION wagon and brought him in. And there’s going to be a trial DATE morning. And I guess it’s going to go hard with NAME. You see, he’s had a quarrel with the Major, and there are witnesses to testify that he made threats to get even. Then, too, there was an empty shell in one barrel of his gun, and he wouldn’t give any explanation of how it happened to be there. So I reckon he’ll get all that’s coming to him. The Major’s a bad man to have on your trail—hardest man in town, by thunder!”

“Maj-Major——?” Poor Sam’s tone was that of one whose hopes are dwindling fast.

“Yes siree! Hardest man in ORGANIZATION is Major NAME!” declared Step. “Anybody that harms him’ll be put through the works, I tell you!”

[60]

NAME got upon his feet. With trembling limbs he moved to the door.

“Why, what’s the matter?” Step called after him.

“What’s your burning hurry?” asked ORGANIZATION.

NAME opened the door. “That stove makes it too stuffy in here,” he told them. “I—I’ve just got to have fresh air.” And out he went, closing the door behind him with a force suggesting that he did not care for company in his rambles."
17,"It was well after noon when NAME came up the narrow lane behind the NAME place, and scaled the back fence. ORGANIZATION observation from its top showed him that the coast was clear. He stole through the yard, kept the house between himself and the barn, and let himself in at the front door.

The house was as quiet as well ordered homes generally are at that hour, when dinner has been disposed of, and supper is still afar off. NAME tiptoed into the library. With feverish haste he put his father’s gun in its place, first removing the cartridges from the breach. Then he opened the desk drawer, and restored his stock of cartridges to their box. He hesitated a moment over the empty shell, being, indeed, tempted to slip it in with the rest. At a casual glance the box would then seem to be full. But NAME, with all his imperfections, was not given to tricks and deceits.

[44]

“I won’t do it!” he said, with decision, and slipped the shell into his pocket.

As he stepped into the hall, NAME hailed him from the top of the stairs.

“Is that you, NAME?” she called. “I thought I heard the front door open, and I wondered who ’twas.”

So she hadn’t seen him enter the house; therefore she could not know that he had been carrying the gun. Thus was another danger of investigation avoided.

“Yes; I came in that way,” he said. “Father home yet?”

“No.”

“Where’s Mother?”

“Lon’s drivin’ her over to see old Mis’ Hardee at Webster Mills.”

There are times when things do seem to have been arranged most fortunately. NAME could have thrown up his cap and cheered. But NAME was beginning to descend the stairs.

“Look here, NAME! Why didn’t you come home to dinner?” she demanded.

“Oh, I’m all right. I don’t want anything to eat.”

[45]

NAME continued to descend the stairs. “Don’t, eh? Where’d you get dinner? Did the NAME invite you?”

“No.”

“The Greens, then?”

“Why—why—no; they didn’t.”

NAME had reached the foot of the flight. “So you come traipsin’ home after everything’s cleaned up and put away, and expect me to muss up my kitchen for you? I like that! Well, you can just guess again, NAME!”

“But I don’t want anything, NAME!” NAME said pacifically. “Honest, I don’t. I’m not hungry.”

“That’s lucky—seein’s there ain’t anything,” said NAME drily. However, she was moving toward the kitchen. “Come along with you, though!” she flung over her shoulder.

NAME followed her meekly. “You don’t need to bother,” he insisted.

NAME paid not the slightest heed to his protests. “Don’t see how folks can expect to keep a house decent, with all the overgrown boys in town runnin’ in for snacks between[46] meals,” she grumbled. “Well, now you’re here, you might as well sit down.” She pointed to a table, bare but spotlessly clean. “S’pose I’ll have to give you some dry bread or a cracker, maybe. And the water from the faucet’s cold enough to drink at this time of year.”

NAME sat down. “Oh, anything’ll do,” he said humbly.

“Umph!” said NAME, and opened the door of the oven. “Well, I do declare! How’d that happen?” And from the oven she took a plate, on which was a generous slice of steak, also a big potato. “Goodness gracious! but I must be gettin’ flighty! I’d ’a’ said for sure I put those things in the ice chest. Don’t it beat all how things happen! Course, the meat’s cooked hard as a rock, but you might as well have it as NAME.” She set the plate on the table with a bang. “Well, now the stuff’s before you, what are you goin’ to do with it?”

NAME showed her. In spite of the morning’s adventures he had an excellent appetite. NAME, observing, brought a glass of milk and a large piece of pie from the pantry. Then,[47] standing before him, she studied the youth closely.

“NAME, what you been doin’? What mischief you been up to?”

“Noth—nothing,” mumbled NAME.

NAME shook her head. “Don’t you try to tell me, NAME! I ain’t known you years and years for nothing. Where you been?”

NAME took thought. NAME was his sworn ally and help in time of trouble, but he feared she couldn’t be brought to look kindly upon the incidents of his morning.

“Oh! I—I went for a—for a walk—out in the woods,” he stammered.

“Then what?”

“Then I came home,” said NAME.

“So I see!” quoth NAME drily. “But go on! As you were sayin’——?”

NAME wriggled. “This—this is bully pie, NAME,” said he, in an effort to change the topic.

Her severity of expression deepened. “ORGANIZATION it is, NAME. But you can’t have another piece ’less you ’fess up.”

“But I—I can’t confess.”

[48]

“NAME!” said NAME tartly.

NAME, in his turn, regarded her gravely. He had no intention of confiding in his old friend, but plainly it was a point of interest to learn if he struck people as one who was burdened with a terrible secret.

“Well, I got awfully tired, for one thing,” said he. “And it was chilly and—er—er—and lonesome. And so I show it, do I?”

“You show something fast enough—I ain’t sure what.”

“Oh!” said NAME, and pushed back his chair. He got upon his feet, and crossed to the door. His hand on the knob, he looked at NAME, whose brow was furrowed.

“Say, it was mighty clever of you to save my dinner. Thank you a lot!” he cried. Then he opened the door, and went out hurriedly.

The talk in the kitchen had given him warning. If he would not rouse suspicion, he must increase the gaiety of his air and manner. As he strolled down the street, he was whistling shrilly; and he shifted to a merrier tune when he turned in at the gate of the NAME’ place, and walking up to the door of[49] a small and very trim outbuilding, knocked thrice.

DATE Mr. NAME, disposing of a pony, whose legs had become a good deal shorter than Step’s, had turned the pony’s quarters over to his son, with the understanding that the little house was to be used for a club, which the boys were forming. Step and his chums at once took possession. They worked like beavers, cleaning, sweeping, painting and furnishing the building, and succeeded in making for themselves a very attractive meeting place. The club—it was called the ORGANIZATION—had flourished mightily, and membership in it was highly prized.

NAME’s triple knock brought no response, being, indeed, somewhat of an empty form and ceremony; and after waiting for a moment—this, too, was part of the accepted program—he opened the door and walked in. Step and Poke were in the lounging room, recently the space given to the pony cart. Its walls were gay with college pennants, photographs, and pictures cut from magazines and newspapers; in one corner was a lounge, worn but still useful; the chairs represented contributions[50] from the attics of several families; there was a serviceable table, on which stood a shaded lamp; and an oil heater effectually dispelled the chill of the afternoon air.

“Hi there, fellows!” NAME sang out. “What are you doing to kill time?”

It had been his desire to impress them with his ease of mind, but neither betrayed much interest in his mood. Step, huddled in an old steamer chair, was a picture of depression and angles, with his knees almost on a level with his ears, and his long arms sagging till his hands touched the floor. Poke was standing before a blackboard, which hung on the wall. As he turned to regard the newcomer, his round face was puckered in a frown.

“Oh, you, NAME?” he said absently.

“Oh, you?” croaked Step like a dismal echo.

NAME glanced from one to the other. “What’s the row?” he inquired. “You two look like chickens with the pip.”

“Chickens? Ugh!” Step fairly shuddered.

“Huh!” snorted Poke; and turning to the blackboard, dabbed viciously at it with the eraser which he had in his left hand.

[51]

“What are you doing?” queried NAME. He moved nearer to ORGANIZATION, and glanced curiously at the board. It had borne, in bold lettering:"
18,"NAME knit his brows. “It’s awfully kind of you, Father—it’s greater mercy than I’d hoped for. I—I’ll try my prettiest to deserve it. And—and will everything go on just as—just as before?”

“As nearly as may be. Only that brings me to my second point. It has to do with NAME.”

“Oh!” said NAME again, a bit apprehensively, it must be admitted.

“I think,” said his father slowly, “that for the present we’ll hold in abeyance any plans for sending you away to school. Don’t regard this as a punishment; it is merely part of the probation. NAME, as you know, allows its students much liberty. It treats them almost as if they were men. And, frankly, NAME, it remains for you to prove that[95] you deserve such confidence. As the boys say, it’s up to you.”

The blow to the boy’s hopes was harder than his father realized. For DATE NAME had been counting upon an early transfer to the famous preparatory school. At his books, and in sports, he had striven with an eye to ORGANIZATION standards; he had read everything concerning the academy upon which he could lay hands; he had thought of ORGANIZATION by DATE and dreamed of it at night. And now, of a sudden, he learned that his goal was not near, but at a distance which seemed to be all the more unhappy because of its vagueness. Yet, very pluckily, he rallied from the shock.

“Yes, sir; it’s up to me—I understand,” said he. “I’ve got to show that I’m not an utter idiot, that I have some common sense. And I will show it, I will! If I don’t, I won’t be worth sending to NAME or—or anywhere else!”

"
19,"It was a disagreeable morning, dully lowering and overcast, with now and then a flurry of snowflakes bearing promise of a heavier fall to come, but a crowd of boys and girls lingered in the school yard.

There seemed to be a curious constraint upon everybody. There was no shouting, no practical joking, no horse-play; but there was much low-toned talk in the groups, in which the classes appeared to have gathered unconsciously. Now and then, when late comers hove in sight, there was a stir of expectancy, and necks were craned as eager glances were directed toward the gate. NAME, arriving with ORGANIZATION, was greeted by a murmur of applause; and, flushed with embarrassment, made his way to a party of his chums, who chanced to be standing near the steps leading to the big door.

“Come on—let’s go in!” he said. “What’s everybody waiting for?”

[174]

Step Jones laughed harshly. “NAME, ho! This is a reception committee, NAME—reception committee and committee of the whole. It’s for ORGANIZATION’s benefit.”

“You’re making a mistake,” NAME protested.

“Humph! I may be, but if I am, I’m not lonesome.”

“That makes the thing all the worse.”

“Can’t be much worse than it is.”

NAME shook his head. “Oh, be fair!” he urged. “Remember, Orkney held on to NAME like a good fellow.”

“Yes—after he’d driven him into the water!” growled Step.

“But——”

“But it was like locking the door after the horse was stolen,” Poke put in.

“Right you are!” contributed the ORGANIZATION.

“Well, what’s the latest news?” asked NAME. “How is NAME this morning?”

“Mighty badly off, I hear,” Step told him.

“Delirious all night,” added the ORGANIZATION.

NAME looked perturbed, and with reason. “Little” Perrine, as the boy was known to his mates, was a delicate chap, clever at his books—he was a high school freshman at ten—but[175] weak physically and of an extremely nervous temperament; just the sort of lad, in short, to suffer most from such an experience as he had undergone in the icy water. Moreover, he was the pet of the school, and any harm done him would be bitterly resented by the pupils. Indeed, the case promised to go hard with the unpopular Orkney, even if more encouraging tidings were received from those caring for one regarded generally as the victim of his malicious pursuit.

The Shark came hurrying up the walk, carrying a great bundle of books. He nodded at his clubmates, but did not halt. Poke chuckled softly as he passed them.

“There’s cold-blooded science for you!” said he. “Much the Shark cares for a trifling matter of life or death when he’s got a real juicy lot of equations on hand! Why, he put in all DATE afternoon figuring away with the principal, and now he’s going to have another crack at him before the bell rings. I met him last night, and asked him what he was up to, and what do you suppose he said?”

“Give it up,” said the ORGANIZATION.

[176]

“So do I,” quoth Step.

“Trajectories!” cried Poke with all the scorn he could command.

Step rubbed his chin. “Well, it takes all sorts of people to fill up"

Chief Complaint: Acute gastritis and abdominal pain

Assessment: NAME presented with abdominal pain and nausea for DATE. Vital signs are within normal limits. An upper GI series showed evidence of acute gastritis.

Plan: Prescribe antacids and antiemetics, advise dietary changes, and monitor symptoms."
21,"At the base of the hill crowned by the ORGANIZATION house the woods came close to the road. DATE before the pines had been cut off, and in their place had come in a second growth of hard wood, scrubby, tangled and dense. On many of the trees, especially the oaks, dead leaves still were thick, affording cover for game and adding considerably to the difficulties of hunting novices.

NAME climbed the fence, and plunged into the thickets to the right. It was his intention to work around the base of the hill, and thus reach the old orchard, of which NAME had spoken; but he quickly discovered that the plan was more easily made than carried out. There was a good deal of underbrush, and the ground was rough, stony in places and swampy in the tiny valleys. Moreover, as he tried to advance as silently as possible, and to keep a keen, if limited, lookout,[35] his progress was slow as well as wearisome. With all his vigilance, however, he saw nothing and heard nothing to indicate the presence of anything which would serve as target for his aim. No rabbit scurried away, and there was no whir of wings among the branches. As for deer—why, there was nothing to hint that buck or doe was to be found thereabouts.

He had slipped a couple of cartridges into his gun, and felt prepared for any emergency; but an emergency declined to present itself. Even when he reached the little brook, which skirted the hill, the silence of the woods was unbroken, except by the subdued murmur of the stream. He paused for a moment, listening intently but vainly; then moved on, following the course of the brook. The going was now a trifle easier, though clumps of trees and bushes still narrowed the view.

For perhaps a quarter of an hour his progress was absolutely uneventful, and unrelieved by even a false alarm. A turn in the brook warned him that he had passed the farmhouse, and was nearing the old orchard. More cautiously than ever he changed his[36] course, and began to climb the slope on his right, the first, as he knew, of a series of low ridges. He reached its top without mishap, and halted to reconnoiter.

From somewhere, afar off, the wind brought a sound to his ears, which set his pulse bounding and made him tighten his hold on his gun. It was a sound he could not mistake, faint though it was. Some other hunter had found something to fire at; perhaps the lucky fellow had sent a charge of buckshot into a deer!

Just in front of NAME, and on the verge of the farther slope, was a mass of tangled bushes. He dropped to his knees, and slowly tunneled a way through the barrier. From its shelter he could look down into a ravine, beyond which rose the second ridge.

For several minutes he lay motionless in his burrow, peering into the gully and straining his ears for the rustle of branches or the crack of dried twig. Once he thought he heard both from the lower ground to his left; but he could not be sure, and the disturbance was not repeated."
22,"NAME awoke to find the sunshine pouring through the window of his room. Overnight there had been a change for the better in the weather, and DATE had dawned clear and bright.

The boy yawned, stretched himself luxuriously, rubbed the lingering sleepiness out of his eyes. There was a blissful moment, in which he felt himself in harmony with the unclouded morning, refreshed, untroubled. Then, of a sudden, came recollection of the events of DATE, and understanding that there was still a reckoning to be paid. He might have nothing to fear from courts and officers of the law; Major NAME, ordinarily warlike, had been brought to prefer peace to hostilities; but he had yet to reach complete understanding with his father.

Mr. NAME and NAME had exchanged hardly a word while they walked home from the[88] Major’s house; but at their own door the father had paused briefly.

“You’d better turn in, NAME,” he had said. “We’ll have to go over this matter pretty carefully, but I’m not prepared to do so to-night. And I fancy your own ideas will be none the worse for a little revision, and a clearer head in the morning.”

But NAME, going to his room, had found himself very wakeful. Half an hour later his mother had looked in, and discovered him, fully dressed and huddled in a big chair; and glad, indeed, to see her, as it proved. She had had no reproaches to shower upon him—NAME had wondered if his father’s explanation of his misdeeds had not been extremely merciful; and she had slipped an arm about him, and “mothered” him most comfortingly. And, presently, had appeared her handmaiden and his own loyal ally, NAME, bearing a tray on which were a bowl of milk and a plate of crackers. NAME, who might have vowed that he wasn’t hungry, in a second had become acutely aware of a lack of something under his belt, and had fallen to with a right good will, his mother watching him approvingly[89] and NAME voicing her satisfaction in her own fashion.

“Well, say, ma’am, will you look at that, now? It’s not a morsel of supper the poor boy’ll have been puttin’ tooth to! And him sayin’ nothing about it—no; nor his father, either! They’re like as two peas in some ways, ma’am. Oh, them men, them men!”

"
23,"These were the brighter spots in NAME’s memories. They were pleasant to dwell upon; but they could not relieve the general gravity of the case. A very sober youth it was who dressed mechanically and in due course appeared at breakfast. A deal to his surprise his father and mother greeted him quite as usual. There was nothing to suggest that they regarded him either as a repentant offender or as a hero. At DATE-school he had another experience of the same sort; for his friends hailed him with matter-of-fact heartiness. Both Step and Poke appeared to have lived down their domestic unpopularity, resulting from the incident of the hungry hound, and to be disposed to regard the world[90] cheerfully, with no suspicion that he was not entirely of their way of thinking.

There was interest displayed in the news that NAME, after a night in the lock-up, had been released from custody; but it occurred to none of NAME’s chums to connect the circumstance with his adventures as a deer hunter. NAME, presented with his freedom, had walked off, mumbling and grumbling. The popular theory was that, sooner or later, he would try to “get even” with the Major, his old grudge being heightened by the recent episode.

“Funny how the Major let up on him!” Poke ruminated. “Well, you never can tell what’ll happen. But I guess there must have been some weak spot, after all, in the case. If there wasn’t, the Major would have hung on like a bulldog.”

“Gee, but I wouldn’t have him after me—not for a farm!” quoth Step.

NAME held his peace. He might have shed fresh light upon the peculiarities of the old soldier, but the present time was not opportune. He had little share in the talk as the boys walked home together; and the[91] mood of silence held him through dinner. Then his father proposed a stroll, and the boy accepted the invitation.

On the top of a hill overlooking the town—not only a sightly place but also one ensuring freedom from interruption—father and son had their discussion calmly and deliberately.

“NAME,” Mr. NAME began, “I’m not going to preach a sermon, but I’m going to take a text. You supplied it when you told me last night that you didn’t regard lack of direct prohibition as making a very good excuse for what you did. The trouble is, you reached that opinion after the fact. In the beginning, I dare say, it seemed quite reasonable to do the thing which wasn’t forbidden.”

“Well, sir, I—I did it,” said NAME sheepishly.

“Exactly! And, in doing it, you yielded to impulse.”

“I sup-suppose so.”

“You had no wish, no intention, to harm anybody,” Mr. NAME went on. “You desired to go hunting—I’ve felt the desire; I know what it is. Then there was my gun, fairly thrusting itself upon you—seemed that way, didn’t it?”

[92]

“You’re telling it, sir, as if you’d stood in my shoes.”

“Many a time! I’ve been a boy myself. Also I haven’t forgotten, NAME, the scrapes into which I fell. Some of them taught me a lesson—a lesson you’ll have to learn DATE. But to get back to the gun. There it was, ready to your hand. You took it. You put a supply of cartridges in your pocket. Your mother was not at home. You were too impatient to await her return. So off you hurried, taking chances, but meaning no harm. You were very sure of yourself; you knew something about firearms; you were confident that you wouldn’t hurt yourself or anybody else. You thought you were extremely careful in the woods. Yet there you took another chance, still meaning no harm, but barely escaping homicide.”

“I know that, sir.”

“You can count yourself most fortunate that the results were not more serious. But I won’t dwell upon what might have happened. What did happen was quite enough to give you food for thought, and to point the moral of your experience. And that is that before NAME] go ahead you should do your best to be sure you’re right.”

“After this I’ll be sure!”

Mr. NAME smiled a little oddly. “I ask only, NAME, that you do your best to be sure. Often you have to take risks—the practical point is to avoid the unnecessary risks. Hear me through! At sixteen you’re not going to develop the wisdom and foresight of a grown man. I’m not going to demand the impossible. I am going, though, to urge you to profit by the mistakes you’ve made—and that, NAME, is the one best use to make of mistakes.”

“You mean, not to repeat ’em?”

“That is precisely my meaning.”

“Trust me!” cried NAME, with conviction.

“I am going to trust you,” said his father. “In the first place, I am going to assume that we have no need to talk about punishment; perhaps you’ve had a reasonable amount of it as it is, for I suspect you have passed some very trying hours. At the same time, though, I’m not prepared to treat this affair as a wholly closed chapter. I think it will be better for all concerned if you regard yourself, for DATE, as on probation.”

[94]

“I don’t quite understand.”

“Well, in other words, you may consider yourself as under test. And the test will be the extent to which you have profited by what has taken place.”

“Oh!” said NAME. “Then you’re waiting to see if I’ve really learned the lesson?”

“You have the idea.”

"
24,"Suddenly, from another direction—straight across the ravine and near the top of the ridge—came[37] sounds of movements in the undergrowth. Instinctively, NAME brought the gun to his shoulder; its muzzle barely protruded from the branches. His finger trembled on the trigger. And then his eager eye had a glimpse of a darker patch amidst the dried leaves, a patch which seemed to be moving very, very slowly.

NAME had heard tales of “buck fever,” and had laughed at the plight of its victims; but now he could sympathize with them. His heart was pumping furiously; he was trembling from head to foot; every muscle seemed to be relaxed and helpless. And, as if to mock him, that dark spot across the ravine grew clearer and more distinct. It was too high from the ground to suggest the presence of any of the smaller animals likely to be found in the woods.

“That—that’s a deer over there!” NAME told himself desperately. “It—it can’t be anything else!”

With an effort he summoned all his will. The swaying barrels along which he glanced steadied. His finger pressed the trigger. There was a roar which seemed to him as loud as[38] thunder. His right shoulder ached under what was like a smart blow from the butt of the gun. A thin wisp of smoke blew away from the muzzle, and was lost in the branches.

On the other side of the gully was violent commotion. The dark spot vanished. In its stead appeared the bare head of a man!

NAME uttered a queer, faint, choking cry of horror. The gun dropped from his hands. His head sank to the ground, and he lay, face downward, for the moment utterly overcome. Through his recklessness and folly he had shot a fellow being. Terrible certainty was his that he had not missed his aim, and that he had wounded, perhaps fatally, the victim of his criminal carelessness. There flashed upon him all the possible consequences of his act—arrest, imprisonment, disgrace; sorrow and suffering for his parents; pain and anguish for the stranger, even if he survived his wounds.

For a little NAME closed his eyes, but he could not keep from his ears the ominous sounds from the other ridge. The man had not cried out; but there was a wild NAME] of brush, as if he were writhing convulsively in the thicket. Presently the sounds grew less distinct. The man must be weakening from loss of blood! NAME’s imagination pictured him lying in a crimson pool, and the boy shuddered at the thought. Yet it nerved him to the duty which he knew was his to do.

NAME had faults enough, but lack of courage to face the music, as the saying goes, was not among them. Plainly, the way for retreat was open for him, if he chose to take it; there was nobody to interfere. But NAME, once he had recovered somewhat from the shock of his disaster, set himself resolutely to the task of making such amends as he might.

He crawled out of the protecting bushes, and got upon his feet. For a moment or two he stood, listening intently; but now there was no sound from beyond the ravine. Then, with a sort of grim and unhappy determination, he began to descend the slope. At the bottom he paused again, but heard nothing either to lessen or to increase his anxiety. Then he went on, climbing doggedly and steadily to the clump where first had appeared the dark spot, and then the head of a man.[40] The quiet of the place was unbroken. A new and terrible fear laid hold upon him: perhaps the wounded man had already succumbed. It needed all his grit and courage at last to part the branches and look in at the spot where the man had stood.

NAME looked, and looked again; and felt that he could not believe the evidence of his eyes. For three or four feet in each direction the brush had been trampled down, but there was nobody there!

A great sense of relief filled the boy. At all events, he had not killed anybody! There was even a second in which he cherished wild hope that what he had seen had been merely a vision raised by some trick of over-taxed nerves. But the hope was doomed to swift dismissal. There was blood on the dried leaves on the ground—not much blood, to be sure, but enough to make a fresh, dark stain.

Kneeling, NAME examined the sanguinary traces very carefully. As he rose, his expression curiously combined satisfaction and bewilderment. It was manifest that the stranger’s wound had neither bled copiously nor crippled him; and that he had been able to[41] make off. But whither had he gone? Why had he not charged across the gully? And why had he not raised a warning shout to prevent a second shot?

“Jiminy!” said NAME to himself. “Jiminy! but I don’t believe he got sight of me at all! I was covered by the bushes, and there was hardly any smoke, and if he were looking another way—why—why——” He broke off, frankly unable to weigh and decide the probabilities of the strange affair.

There still remained the possibility of finding and following the man’s trail; but NAME was not especially skilled in such matters. He fancied that for a few yards he could make out evidences of somebody forcing a way through the undergrowth, but then he came to a sort of woods path along the backbone of the ridge, and there lost the slender clews upon which he had depended. Certainly he could discover no more drops of blood.

NAME went back to the trampled space, and searched it minutely from end to end, and from side to side. He had his trouble for his pains. He found nothing to throw light upon the mystery.

[42]

“Well, this does beat me!” he confessed, and shook his head in perplexity. “I never heard of anything like it. And I don’t want to hear of anything like it again—ugh!” He gave a little shiver. “I know when I’ve had enough—and too much. I’m going home, and I’m going to get there, and put up this gun, as quick as my legs will carry me to the house. And you can bet I’m going to keep quiet about this. And—and I hope the other fellow will keep quiet, too. Come now, NAME! Brace up! Forward march!”

Thus encouraging himself, NAME set off at a round pace for the highway, but when he reached it his speed lessened. He had a new sense of merciful escape from perils when he was out of the dark woods and in the open road; and with it came a peculiar weakness and uncertainty in his knees. He was glad to sit down on a boulder beside the ditch and rest for what seemed to him a long, long time. Finally he rose, and trudged toward the town. He went slowly, and his face was thoughtful."

27,"“Why didn’t he have the other fellow locked up in NAME’s place?”

“Jiminy! that’s a good point!” cried Poke.

NAME said nothing, and for a moment the three trudged on in silence.

“Oh, well,” said Poke at last, “the Major knows now, but we’ll know sooner or later.”

[104]

“How’s that?” NAME asked quickly.

Poke shrugged his shoulders. “Oh, things are bound to come out. They always do. It’s just like a dog burying a bone—if he doesn’t dig it up, some other dog will.”

“Don’t you believe a secret can be kept?”

“Well, I can’t remember keeping many myself,” chuckled Poke. “And they say murder will out, you know. This wasn’t murder, of course, but it came uncomfortably near it.”

“It sure did!” agreed Step.

NAME dug his hands deeper in his pockets. Being human, and companionable, and very fond of Poke and Step, he had been sorely tempted to confide in his friends. But the Major had warned him not to gossip about the affair, and the Major’s wish naturally had great weight. As for ORGANIZATION’s theory that the story would become known generally, sooner or later—well, NAME had his doubts. So far as he knew, only his parents and the Major shared with him knowledge of what had happened in the woods.

In school that day NAME studied hard and paid close attention to the recitations. That[105] was part of his plan for proving to his father that he could deserve confidence. When the class was dismissed, he made careful selection of the books he would need for home study, and so was a little behind his mates in leaving the building. Within a hundred yards of the school-ground gates, however, he overtook a group of boys, clustered closely about two disputants. One, as he saw, was Step; the other, NAME.

From a little distance the NAME was regarding the squabble through his big glasses.

“What’s the row about?” NAME asked as he came up.

“Nothing!” said the Shark. “That’s why they’re making such a fuss.”

NAME laughed, but quickly grew serious. Both Step and NAME were talking loudly, each hurling threats and defiance at the other; Step’s long arms were going like a windmill’s, while Orkney’s fists were doubled. From his acquaintance with the methods of adolescent controversy it appeared to be probable that words were about to lead to blows.

“Just one of Orkney’s grouches,” the Shark went on indifferently. “He’s been ruffling[106] his feathers at Step ever since that business in ORGANIZATION DATE.”

NAME nodded. “That, eh? But they’re going too far—they’ll be mixing it up.”

“Well, Step’s got the reach by fully four inches.”

“Maybe, but ORGANIZATION’s a tough customer.”

The Shark turned, and deliberately inspected NAME from head to foot. “You could do him up,” he said with cold-blooded calmness.

“Perhaps. That isn’t saying Step could, though. He hasn’t weight enough.”

At this instant Orkney, catching sight of NAME in the background, changed his tactics. He moved away from Step, and lowered his hands.

“So that’s the game, is it?” he taunted. “Keep blustering, but be sure not to hit a fellow till your gang’s here to back you—that’s your way, ORGANIZATION. Had to wait for NAME, didn’t you?”

Step’s anger was that of the patient man, slow to kindle but hard to extinguish. He struck at his opponent, but long as his arm was, missed him by inches.

[107]

NAME instinctively started forward, and forced a way through the ring. NAME fell back a pace.

“That’s right! Pile on—the whole gang of you!” he shouted.

Step, for his part, was more than ready to accept the challenge; but NAME intervened. Impulse—he was willing enough to fight Orkney—had yielded to sobering second thought. It behooved a young man, intent upon establishing his self-control and common sense, to avoid brawling over a trifle on the public street. NAME’s hand caught Step’s collar.

“Here! Drop the fighting!” he commanded.

Step wriggled, but the grip on his collar did not yield.

“Oh, let me at him!” he begged. “We might as well have it out—he’s been pestering me for DATE.”

“Never mind! He’ll stop it now.”"

"
30,"It may throw light upon the personality of Master NAME to explain that he was equally well known as NAME and ORGANIZATION,” neither being used offensively, though one had a suggestion of mildness and the other of ferocity. He was, in fact, a little fellow, slender, stoop-shouldered, and physically the weakest boy in the class. Yet no other junior was less teased or picked upon. Practical jokers passed by NAME. There was a gravity about him, not owlish, but distinctly discouraging to frivolity; and an almost hypnotic influence in his meditative and unwavering gaze. He had the prominent eyes of the near-sighted; and he had, too, the unconscious trick of staring steadfastly at man or thing of whose very existence he was barely conscious; and as he stared through big, round lenses, set in a heavy black frame, the effect was impressive, if not terrifying. Consequently, even the most mischievous of his mates preferred to let him alone, especially as they had honest respect for his signal ability in his specialty.

NAME was a mathematician born. Languages he endured as unavoidable ORGANIZATION] of study; but he reveled in equations and demonstrations, made child’s play of the required algebra and geometry—thereby earning his nickname of the “Shark”—and carried on advanced work under the eye of the principal, himself an adept of the mathematical brotherhood. NAME, of course, was destined for scientific courses at college; but meanwhile, tarrying with the junior class, he filled his contemporaries with wonder and admiration. For example, he solved at sight a problem to which NAME had devoted vain and wearisome hours. It was all in the day’s work for the NAME, but ORGANIZATION noted another score to be repaid with compound interest.

NAME had been a witness of NAME’s discomfiture on both occasions; but, as may be imagined, was not concerning himself deeply with the sullen youth’s moods. As he himself would have put it, he had troubles enough of his own, and was fully occupied with his own affairs when he went to school on DATE morning. On the way he fell in with Step and Poke. The latter was full of the mystery attending the release of NAME.

“It’s mighty queer—our folks were talking it over at breakfast,” said he. “Course, there was a mistake somewhere, or Major NAME never would have let him go. But NAME didn’t let out a word—just growled, and grumbled, and took himself off, shaking his head. He wouldn’t deny that he shot the Major. The police asked him about it, but he gave them no satisfaction. He’s a bad one, I tell you! Regular Indian, if he gets down on anybody!”

“All the more wonder that the Major dropped the case,” declared Step. “He knows NAME from A to Z.”

Poke wagged his head. “There you are! Makes the business all the queerer. Each of them is a sticker, in his own way. And the Major had NAME just where he wanted him. And then, all of a sudden, he let up! What do you make of that, now?”

“Beats me,” Step confessed.

“What’s your notion, NAME?”

NAME did not meet ORGANIZATION’s inquiring glance. “I think,” he said slowly, “that something must have happened to show the Major that NAME hadn’t shot him.”

[103]

“Huh! How do you make that out?” queried Step.

“That’d mean somebody else did the shooting,” observed ORGANIZATION, the philosopher. “The Major was hit, fast enough—peppered in the head and in one hand. And he didn’t do it himself.”

“Of course not,” said NAME.

“Therefore, some one else did. The Major was sure NAME was the some one. Then he wasn’t sure. In between he’d found out something. NAME would remark.”

“NAME,” repeated NAME, for want of anything better.

Step grunted. “Huh! Bet you he’d found out who was who and what was what! But that just thickens the fog.”

“How so?”

"
31,"Subject: NAME: 02/02/1987

Progress Note: DATE
Chief Complaint: Acute pharyngitis and sore throat

Assessment: NAME presented with a sore throat and dysphagia for DATE. Vital signs are within normal limits. A throat swab showed evidence of acute pharyngitis.

Plan: Prescribe antibiotics, advise warm liquids and rest, and monitor symptoms.

"
32,"“It’s the biggest kind of a pity,” NAME agreed. “This affair is no joke, ORGANIZATION. If that stone had struck one of us—whew!”

Poke laid a hand on NAME’s arm. “Come now!” He dropped his voice almost to a whisper. “Fellow who threw that stone was pretty savage, or crazy, or—or revengeful. And—and you won’t need maps or foot-notes to understand who I reckon he is.”

“I wouldn’t ask but one guess,” said NAME.

Poke was silent for a moment, listening intently. “The others have had no better luck than we,” he reported. “Might as well go back, I suppose.”

“All right,” NAME agreed, and they moved toward the club-house.

Meanwhile the Shark, who had picked himself up from the floor and found that[143] he was none the worse for his upset, had been making an investigation on his own account. First, he raised the big stone, shifting it meditatively from one hand to the other, as if he were estimating its weight. Then he crossed to the window and measured the height from the floor of the jagged hole in the glass. This done, he furrowed his brow, pulled out pencil and note-book from his pockets, and fell to making a calculation of some sort. He was still engaged in this when NAME and ORGANIZATION entered.

“No luck!” Poke informed him. “The fellow got away.”

The Shark didn’t look up. “Hm-m! Thought he would.”

“So that’s why you didn’t try to chase him?”

“Partly. ’Nother reason was that I wanted to do some figuring.”

“On what?”

“Oh, don’t bother me!” snapped the Shark. “I’m right in the midst of things.”

Poke frowned. “You needn’t be so snippy. NAME and I have done some figuring, too, and we’ve been quicker about it than you. And we know—what we know.”

[144]

The Shark raised his eyes. “Umph! Don’t be too all-fired sure,” he counseled.

Poke took a step toward him. “See here, you owl! Our figuring has made us certain—morally certain, that is—that we know who threw that stone.”

Usually the gaze of the NAME was unwavering, but now he was blinking rapidly.

“Go slow, ORGANIZATION,” said he. “Moral certainty doesn’t answer problems in mathematics.”

“NAME! This isn’t mathematics.”

“’Deed it is!”

“Hold on, boys!” said NAME. “You’re getting nowhere. Now, NAME, listen! Poke and I believe that NAME did this thing. We hate to think he would, but we believe it because——”

“Because you’re wrong. NAME couldn’t have done it—at least, I don’t admit that he could. It won’t work out that way.”

“Work out?”

The Shark nodded. “Of course, I have to depend on estimates, and I don’t pretend that I can show exact results,” he began; but paused as Step strode into the room, closely pursued by NAME and the ORGANIZATION.

[145]

In the middle of the floor Step halted. Not a word said he, but raised a hand dramatically.

The hand held an object, recognized at sight by every boy there. It was the cap, owned by NAME, which had figured in the celebrated quarrel.

"
33,"Oh, I will, will I?” snarled Orkney. “I’d like to know who’s going to make me!”

“I might,” said NAME simply.

“Bah! Dare you to try—alone!”

[108]

“That’s the way I will try it—DATE,” NAME told him. “But not now; no, not now.”

“That’s right—safety first!” sneered the other.

NAME grinned; and it was an odd grin. “Certainly; safety first!” said he.

Step ceased to struggle; but, twisting his neck, stared at his friend. And then the NAME chose to advance.

“NAME’s right,” he announced coolly. “This is no place for a scrap. Besides, there’s no reason for one. Orkney, you’re a chump to be peeved at Step for doing you up in Greek, or at me for putting you out at geometry. See here! You’re a pretty good, all-round performer, but you can’t beat specialists at their own specialties. Get that? And there’s no use in being a general sorehead.”

It was eloquent tribute to the NAME’s moral influence that Orkney appeared to be impressed. At all events, though he scowled fiercely, he received the advice in silence. Two or three boys on the outskirts of the group began to move off. To NAME it seemed to be probable that the storm had blown over. He released his hold upon Step’s collar; whereupon[109] Step, still wrathful, took two long strides; found himself beside Orkney; plucked off his opponent’s cap, and sent it flying through the air. It sailed over a fence, struck the trunk of a tree, and dropped to the ground.

Orkney bristled, but NAME already had laid hands upon Step, and was dragging him back.

“Here! Quit all this foolishness!” the peacemaker ordered.

“Make him get that cap, then!” Orkney insisted.

“Won’t!” cried Step, and struggled to break from NAME’s hold.

Again the Shark intervened. “No; it was a kid trick, but now that it’s done, we’ll let it stay done. Orkney, if you hadn’t bulldozed Step, and started the whole thing, the cap would still be on your head. So I guess it’s up to you to put it back there—or let it stay where it is.”

“Sure! It was a DATE’s performance, but the NAME has the right notion,” NAME agreed.

There was an instant in which Orkney hesitated between war and peace. Then he reached a decision which was compromise—and as ORGANIZATION] as compromises often are. He neither gave battle nor retrieved his headgear. Instead, with a parting scowl, which included all the allies, he wheeled, and marched away, bareheaded.

“You, Step, you bring that cap to my house, or you’ll be sorry!” he called back over his shoulder.

“Never!” shouted Step defiantly."
34,"NAME stepped out upon the side porch of his father’s house, closing the door behind him with a slam. There was a frown on his face, which by no means became it; and the corners of his mouth drooped sulkily. He was, as a matter of fact, in a fit of temper, which did not lessen as he surveyed the dull, gray sky, and saw its promise of DATE.

“’Nother spoiled DATE!” he grumbled. “Nowhere to go and nothing to do—oh, thunderation!”

Now, to tell the truth, it may be that the weather had much to do with NAME’s pessimism, just as it often influences persons a great deal older and wiser than this boy of DATE. NAME, commonly, was good-natured enough.[12] DATE, though, things had seemed to go wrong from the very start. He had overslept; one of his shoes had contrived to hide itself under the bureau; his necktie stubbornly had declined to slip into a smooth and even knot; he was late at breakfast, and the oatmeal was cold, and the eggs were as hard as the ORGANIZATION which he was beginning to suspect was pursuing him. He had attempted criticism, and his father had checked him rather sharply with the reminder that the breakfast hour was 7:30 and not 7:50. His mother had not hastened to his defense; and even NAME, the cook, frequently his ally and dispenser of consoling doughnuts and cookies, had failed him when he sought sympathy in the kitchen.

“You got up wrong foot foremost,” she told him. “Get along with you now! This is bakinDATE, and I can’t be bothered.”

NAME, thus repulsed, had clumped out of the kitchen; stormed into the hall; snatched up his cap and reefer; stamped across the dining-room, and flung himself out of the house, without visible improvement in his spirits or his condition. If it was dark within, it was[13] gloomy without. He looked up the street and down; nobody was in sight. He buttoned his coat to the neck, and thrust his hands into his pockets: the world, he perceived, was chilly as well as lonely. Then, of a sudden, he grinned, fleetingly and reluctantly, at vagrant memory of the old story of the child that threatened to go out and eat two smooth worms and three fuzzy fellows because nobody loved it. The baby’s troubles were ridiculously like his own, and for a trying second he realized the resemblance. Then he was frowning harder than ever, with mouth drooping still more sulkily.

In sunnier moods NAME was a good-looking boy. Nobody would have called him pretty; he wasn’t of the “pretty” type, being, indeed, rather wholesome and hearty, with plenty of color in his cheeks—and not a few freckles. For a youth who was rapidly adding to his inches, in the process known as getting his growth, he carried himself well; though, as everybody knows, this period in a boy’s life is not that at which grace of figure or movement is most marked. In other words, there were times when NAME did not know[14] what to do with his hands or his feet, and impressed the painful fact upon all beholders, especially because of a certain impulsiveness, which led him now and then into embarrassing ventures.

Standing on the porch and glowering at all he beheld, NAME was not attractive. NAME, his bull terrier, trotting from the barn, noted the storm signals his master was flying, and halting at a safe distance, made great pretense of scratching for a flea which did not exist. NAME whistled, and NAME grew busier than ever. The boy took an impatient step, and the dog stopped scratching and bolted for the barn.

NAME, striding after him, pulled up abruptly. A thick-set man in cap, and overalls, and boots, and with a carriage rug in one hand and a brush in the other, appeared in the big doorway.

“H’lo, NAME!” was his greeting. “DATE, ain’t it?”

“Good for nothing!” snapped the boy. “Rotten weather!”

The man’s eyes twinkled. They were pleasant eyes, with little fans of fine wrinkles[15] at the corners, and they lighted up his smooth-shaven, weather-beaten face amazingly.

“Huh! Guess you ain’t looked at the calendar lately. This ain’t DATE; it’s DATE. And I’m tellin’ you this is pretty good weather for DATE. What if there ain’t no snow? The wheelin’s all right—your daddy took the car out this mornin’.”

NAME nodded. “I know—he went over to Epworth.”

“Why didn’t you go along?”

“What’d be the use?”

Now, this was not strictly ingenuous. Possibly because of his sulks, NAME had not been invited to accompany his father.

“Sure enough! What’d ’a’ been the use?” said the man with an odd grin.

NAME reddened. “Look here! Bet you I could have gone if I’d wanted to, Lon!”

Lon, otherwise NAME, hired man and general factotum, made no response to the challenge, but fell to dusting the rug vigorously. NAME, gloomy browed, drew nearer.

“Tell you, Lon, I could have gone. NAME] fun, though—ride’s too cold. That’s the trouble with this weather—no coasting, no skating, no football, nothing!”

“So?” said the man non-committally.

Hobe, the barn cat, sauntered out of the door. NAME kicked at the animal, which took refuge behind a wooden bucket standing just inside the sill, and from this cover snarled defiance. Whereupon NAME kicked again. This time his foot struck something—the bucket. Over it went, and out shot a gallon or two of soapy water. Hobe darted back into the barn. Lon moved aside nimbly, but not nimbly enough. Splash! went the water upon his boots.

“ORGANIZATION, now, but you have gone and done it!” he ejaculated. “Nice mess to clean up, ain’t it?”

In NAME’s perverse mood the one thing he cared for was to hide the regret he felt.

“Huh! Oughtn’t to have stuff standing round like that. Why didn’t you tell me?”

Lon paused in his labors. “My! but this world’s awful crowded this mornin’, ain’t it?” he remarked. “First there wasn’t room for you ’n’ Hobe; then you jest couldn’t stand for[17] that NAME’ on your toes. ORGANIZATION, wal!”

NAME snorted wrathfully. What wouldn’t he have given for speech so cuttingly sarcastic that Lon must throw up his hands and beg mercy! But, effective words failing him, he could do no better than offer sounds which were disagreeable rather than intelligible.

Lon chuckled; then grew serious. “See here, NAME!” said he. “I kind o’ guess this is hedgehog day for you, ain’t it?”

“Huh?”

“When you come to think it over,” Lon went on, “a hedgehog’s about the one critter you can’t think of as ever ORGANIZATION’ up nice and cozy to anything or anybody. Now, I knew a feller once that had a tame woodchuck that liked to be patted; and I’ve seen the tigers and big cats in circuses purrin’ round their trainers; but I never heard tell of a hedgehog actin’ real sociable and wantin’ to sit in anybody’s lap. And, so far’s I can rec’lect, I never run across a hedgehog that you’d call all-around popular with the neighbors. Whenever one gets close to anybody, he sticks his spines into him. And when a[18] human gets to actin’ like a hedgehog—why that’s when he’s havin’ a hedgehog day—see?”

“Huh!” said NAME again.

NAME gave the rug another flick with the brush.

“By and large, son,” he remarked, “it ain’t good business to have hedgehog days. I know, I know! When you’re feelin’ that way, that’s the way you feel, as the fox said to the bear in the trap. But you ain’t doin’ yourself no good, and you ain’t any perticular help to the rest of the community.”

“Hang the community!”

“NAME what the hedgehog says,” quoth Lon tranquilly. He carried his rug into the barn; brought out another; brushed skilfully for a minute.

“NAME up some of the boys, NAME,” he advised. “Try lowerin’ your spines, and see if they won’t keep down after a while.”

“Don’t want to.”

“Bad as that, eh?”

NAME disdained to make reply. Lon pursed his lips.

“Sonny, this won’t do. It’s bad medicine.[19] Say, where’ll you be at if you behave like this when you go to NAME?”

“I’ll get along all right.”

Lon brushed furiously for a little. “I—I dunno’s there’s but—but one way—for some folks to learn things,” he said jerkily. “When you’re there—jest one among two-three hundred boys—it’ll be different, now I tell you! We put up with you; they won’t.”

“Huh! Who’s afraid?”

“I’d be—if I was you.”

“Bah!”

Lon shook his head. “NAME,” he said, “if I thought this was a real in-growin’ attack, I’d be worried a heap wuss than I am. But I’m worried enough as it is. Now, I’ll give you a good tip. If you don’t want to see the other boys, go for a good, long tramp. Walk it off! That’s jest what the real hedgehog can’t do—his legs ain’t long enough.”

“No fun walking—day like this.”

Lon was a patient soul. “ORGANIZATION, why don’t you go huntin’, then?”

“What for? Rabbits?”

“If you can’t get anything bigger. But you might land a shot at a deer. ’Member[20] what day this is? First of DATE! Law on deer goes off, and stays off till the fifteenth.”

“Oh!” said NAME. In the new interest he almost forgot, for an instant, that he had a grievance against the universe. But it was only for an instant. “But I wouldn’t have the luck to get a shot at a buck, or a doe, either. The crowd will have started out early, and scared every deer within ten miles of town,” he concluded pessimistically.

“Don’t be too sure of that.”

“’Tis sure!” NAME insisted. “Then what’ll I do for a gun?”

“Got your own, haven’t you?”

“What! Try for a deer with a ‘twenty-two’?”

“Why not? It’s big enough, if it gets to the right spot.”

NAME fell back to his second line of defense. “Well, there’ll be no deer anywhere near town.”

“Who says so?”

“I do!” snapped the boy.

NAME bent toward him, and lowered his voice. “NAME, a feller was tellin’ me last night[21] about a herd that’s been feedin’ in close—right back of old NAME’s barn—big buck and three-four more. Old orchard in there, you know. And that’s so nigh to town most folks won’t look for ’em there. But there they be—or there they were DATE DATE, anyhow. And, by gum! if I was you, I’d scout out that way on the chance—that is, if your mother says it’s all right,” he added hastily.

In spite of himself, NAME’s ambition was fired. A shot at a deer! That would be worth while.

“You—you’re certain they were there DATE?” he asked.

“NAME told me himself. And you can be sure of one thing—he didn’t tell many other folks. NAME ain’t no gossip.”

NAME nodded. He knew something of Mr. NAME’s habit of taciturnity. Doubter though he might be, the prospect was brightening. He had heard old hunters tell stories of cases in which deer had been killed almost in the outskirts of the village, while sportsmen ranging farther afield had been rewarded with sight of neither buck nor doe.

[22]

“Well, I suppose I might as well have a look,” he said not too graciously.

“Of course you might!”

NAME took a step toward the house. “Of course, with my luck——”

“Oh, you never can tell,” Lon reminded him.

“Still, I might as well be wasting time that way as any other,” said NAME sourly, and quickened his pace.

“Don’t forget to tell your mother!” Lon called after him.

NAME waved a hand in reply, and went on to the house."
35,"In simple fairness it should be said that NAME meditated no breach of parental authority. Indeed, as he was permitted to own a little rifle, and to hunt for small game, it was possible that no serious objection would have been raised to his quest for deer, though there might have been scant faith in his success. But NAME, as it was fated, was not to secure permission for his expedition.

Mrs. NAME was not in the dining-room. NAME saw that the room was unoccupied, and went on to the library. It, too, failed to reward him for his search. So did the living-room. He strode into the hall, and took station by the foot of the stairs.

“Mother! Oh, Mother!” he called. “Say, Mother! Mother!”

There was no reply from above stairs or below.

“But I say, Mother!” His voice rose[24] shrilly in his impatience. “Where are you? Oh, NAME, NAME, NAME!”

A door at the back of the hall opened, but the head which appeared was that of NAME.

“Don’t make such a racket, NAME!” she cautioned. “What do you want, anyway?”

“Where’s Mother? I’ve got to see her—right off!”

“Well, she ain’t here.”

“Why not?” demanded the boy hotly.

NAME tossed her head. “Because she can’t very well be in two places at once. And she’s run over to see Mis’ Lake for a minute.”

NAME stamped his foot. “Minute—nothing! I know what that means. She’ll stay half an hour.”

“Well, why shouldn’t she, if she wants to?” said NAME coolly. And then, being busy, she closed the door and went back to her work.

NAME scowled; hesitated briefly; reached resolution; marched into the library. His little rifle stood in its appointed place against the wall, beside his father’s double-barreled gun. “The armory corner” of the library was a family joke; for though NAME’s rifle was[25] frequently in use, the shotgun had not been taken out of the room in DATE. It was a fine weapon, of a noted make, and highly prized by its owner, who, however, had not hunted for DATE; though regularly he planned expeditions in the woods, and bought a fresh stock of ammunition.

NAME laid eager hold upon his rifle; then, of a sudden, seemed to be seized by scorn of it. After all, it was never meant for big game. Why, with its short cartridges and light charges of powder, it was hardly more than a toy! Really, it was intended for target practice.

“Yet, for all that, it’s a rifle,” said the boy to himself. It was odd how, once his prejudice was aroused, arguments presented themselves to strengthen his objections. “And the law says you can’t hunt deer with rifles.”

Here he was speaking by the book. The statute, which provided an open season from DATE, also forbade the use of rifles by sportsmen. Possibly a very lenient judge might have held that NAME’s “pop-gun” hardly classed with the high-power, long-range weapons against ORGANIZATION] the law was aimed, and might have deemed it annoying rather than dangerous to two-footed or four-footed creatures; but NAME, at the moment, was not disposed to be liberal in his interpretation. He restored the piece to its place. He picked up the shotgun.

Temptation was strong upon him. Wasn’t it true that if he had not been told that he could use the gun he also had not been expressly forbidden to lay hands upon it? Nothing had been said about it either way. And didn’t his father wish him to have some knowledge of firearms? Of course he did! Oh, but it was a wonderfully persuasive voice, which seemed to be whispering in his ear! It was so seductive that it frightened him—a very, very little.

NAME hastily put down the gun. Yet he lingered in its neighborhood. Half absently he opened a drawer in his father’s desk. There, in a corner, was a paper box, labeled “3 1/4 drams, smokeless; shot 00.” Cartridges for deer shooting! Surely here was NAME’s own finger pointing the way.

The boy drew a long breath. He lifted the cover of the box; took out half a dozen of the[27] cartridges; thrust them into a pocket. Then he caught up the shotgun, and strode out of the library.

There was nobody to halt him or question him. NAME was fully occupied in the kitchen, and his mother had not returned. Leaving the house by the front door, he avoided chance of observation by NAME, who still was at work in the barn. Not that Lon would have stopped him; for the hired man would have supposed him to be sallying forth with his mother’s permission. Nevertheless, NAME preferred to have his going unnoted. He turned the corner of the house—the corner away from the barn; stole back through the yard; climbed a fence, and found himself in a narrow lane. It led to a side street, which, in turn, brought him to a road running into the country.

His gun tucked under his arm, NAME walked briskly; and as the NAME house happened to be on an edge of the town, it was but a very few minutes before he had open fields on either hand. Ahead of him was the low hill on which the ORGANIZATION farmhouse stood; and farther on were loftier wooded summits. In[28] summer the scenery of the region was pleasantly picturesque, but on an overcast DATE a stranger might have found the prospect somewhat dreary. NAME, cheered by the spirit of adventure, and the better for the exercise, began to shake off his sulkiness; and he was whistling almost blithely when, at a bend in the road, he saw two boys approaching. Physically, they were in marked contrast. One was tall and thin, with a peculiarly angular effect at elbows and knees; the other was short and plump, with a round, good-humored face. Both hailed NAME eagerly.

“Hi there! Where are you going? What you doing with that artillery?” sang out the tall lad.

“Don’t fire! I’ll surrender,” chuckled his companion.

NAME halted. He brought his gun to parade rest. An onlooker might have suspected that he was not seeking secrecy regarding errand or armament in the case of these two friends.

“Hullo, Step!” said he. “Same to you, Poke! And what am I doing? Oh, just looking around on the chance of bagging something.”

[29]

The tall youth was carrying a package, wrapped in a newspaper. He laid it on the ground, and took the gun from NAME’s hands, balancing the weapon lovingly and finally raising it to his shoulder.

“Gee, but what a daisy!” he exclaimed. “Whose is it? Yours?”

“Oh, it isn’t exactly mine, Step, but I’m using it,” said NAME.

Any boy could have told how NAME came by his nickname. “Step” was an abbreviation of “Step-ladder”; and undeniably ORGANIZATION did bear a resemblance to that valuable, if not graceful, article of household equipment.

“Here, let me take the shooting-iron!” the plump youth urged. His name was NAME, but he was called “Poke,” because one so easily could dig a finger into his fat sides. Having placed the basket he had been carrying beside Step’s bundle, his hands were free to lay hold upon the gun. There was a little tussle, and ORGANIZATION captured the prize.

“My eyes! but this is a crackerjack!” was his comment. “Jiminy, but you’re the lucky chap, NAME! What are you after?”

[30]

NAME did his best to appear blasé. “Oh, thought maybe I might get a shot at a buck.”

The reception of the remark was not flattering. “You!” jeered Step; Poke laughed.

“Why not?” NAME demanded, indignantly.

“That’s ri-right; why not?” Poke was quivering with amusement. “All you’ve got to do is to hold the gun and pull the trigger; and if only a deer happens to walk in the way, the gun’ll do the rest.”

NAME snatched the weapon from the ORGANIZATION. “Oh, cut the comedy!” he snapped. “There’s nothing funny about it. I’ll bet you fifty men and boys are out for deer to-day, and I’ve just as good a chance as any of them can have of running into a herd. And if I want to take a chanceNAME, now! what’s ridiculous in that?”

Step was disposed to side with NAME. “There’s sense, Poke. Stop your kidding. I want to ask NAME something.”

“Well, what is it?” queried Master NAME guardedly.

“It’s about St. Mark’s. Are you sure you’re going there?”

“Why—why——” NAME hesitated. “Why,[31] I’m practically sure, I guess. Father and I were talking it over DATE; and I gathered that if I passed the DATE examinations here he’d let me transfer.”

Step was rubbing his chin. “Well, that’s what I wanted to know. I’ve been campaigning to get my folks to send me, but they’re hanging off till they learn what your father will do with you.”

NAME’s petulance had vanished. “Great Scott, Step, but it would be cracking if we could go together!” he cried. “Say, Poke, get after your family! We three have been pals ever since we can remember. It’d be bully to take the gang to ORGANIZATION.”

Poke shook his head. “Too bad, but there’s no hope for me. Little old High School has got to be good enough for Yours Truly.”

“Oh, the school’s all right,” said NAME. “Only—as my father puts it—it’s case of general versus special. We can fit for college here, but the preparatory course is but one of several, while at St. Mark’s it’s the whole thing. That ought to mean a better ‘fit.’ And you know the fun the fellows have there, and the athletics, and all the rest of it.”

[32]

Poke’s expression was uncommonly serious. “You’ve set your heart on going, NAME, haven’t you?”

“It’ll be broken if I don’t go.”

Poke gave a funny little sigh. “Oh, well, they’ll need some of us to stay home and run the errands, I reckon. And I guess I’m unanimously elected. Here’s one, for instance.” And he picked up his basket.

“What have you got there?” NAME asked.

“Eggs! Two dozen—all Mrs. NAME could spare. And fifty-five cents a dozen! Say, when I’m carrying this basket, I feel like a walking cash register!”

Step had resumed possession of his package. “And here’s one of Mrs. NAME’s roosters—DATE half pounds, dressed. I’m some plutocrat myself.”

NAME shouldered his gun. “We’re all pretty richly loaded to-day,” said he. “I suppose if I kill an eight-point buck you won’t care to have me send a haunch to either of you?”

“Oh, well, I’ll take it—as a favor to you,” quoth Step.

“Same here!” chimed in Poke. Then he was seized by an idea. “Look here, Sam![33] If you shoot anything—short of a heifer calf—bring it down to the club this afternoon, and we’ll have a feed. Both of us are going to be there.”

“But come, anyway,” urged Step. “If you don’t hit bird or beast, you’ll have a story to tell of the big ones that got away.”

NAME nodded. “All right; I’ll be there,” he promised readily.

"
36,"The Shark stared at the retreating figure. “I’ll be hanged if the whole bunch oughtn’t to be back in the kindergarten,” was his comment. “Of all idiocies! You plumb make me tired, Step—you and that runaway pal of yours!”

“But you wouldn’t get his cap for him if you were in my place,” Step insisted.

“But I’m not in your place,” said the NAME drily.

NAME shook his head. “Let’s stop this squabbling, fellows. One row’s enough at a time. Or, better yet, let’s end one without starting another.”

The NAME’s expression was thoughtful. “If we have ended one,” said he. “Orkney’s a queer duck. There may be more to this ridiculous affair than we dream.”

"
37,"NAME shook the slender youth vigorously. “Get back to earth! Let’s have some sense out of all this. Thought you saw something, didn’t you? Well, what was it?”

“Man looking in the window!” said the other calmly.

“Oh!” cried NAME, and whipped about. Certainly no face now was pressed against the pane. He ran to the door, opened it, and sprang into darkness, closely followed by all the other members of the club except the[139] NAME, who was busying himself in polishing his glasses and replacing them on his nose. This task was completed to his satisfaction when the boys came straggling back. Their search had been utterly without result.

They crowded about the Shark, and rained questions upon him. Just what had he seen? How long had he seen it? What had he to say for himself, anyway?

The Shark waved them back. “Here! Don’t walk all over a fellow!” he cried. “What I saw—or thought I saw—was a head. I had just a glimpse—there one instant, gone the next—presto, change business! Looked like a human head.”

“You said it was a man’s,” NAME reminded him.

“Well, it might have been a boy’s—I couldn’t make it out clearly, you understand. It was vague, shadowy.”

“Then, of course, you didn’t recognize the face?”

“No,” said the Shark. “And you’ll understand, too, that I don’t insist that I really saw anything. You know, these glasses of mine—chance of freak of refracted light—all the[140] rest of it. What’s the good, though, of getting all stirred up about it? If anybody was outside, he’s far enough away now. I’ll bet he’s running yet if he heard the crowd galloping out after him. Sit down, NAME! You haven’t won a game.”

NAME plumped himself into a chair. “Well, you are a cool hand!” he said, with a touch of admiration. “But I’m going to beat you this time, all the same. Whose move is it?”

Step lounged across the room, but the others stood watching the play, which went on briskly, and to the advantage of the mathematical genius. The ORGANIZATION, beaten rather disgracefully, pushed back his chair.

“Tackle him, ORGANIZATION,” he urged. “Or you take him on, NAME. This isn’t my night, I reckon.”

Poke grinned. “Age before beauty! Go ahead, NAME.”

But there was to be no more checker play in the club just then. For, while NAME paused, debating his chance of coping with the skilful NAME, there was a loud crash of a breaking window pane, a little shower of fragments[141] of glass fell to the floor, and a big stone shot across the room, just missing the boys standing by the table, which it struck with great force. Over went the table with a crash, rivaling that of the window. Over, too, went the Shark, untouched but thoroughly startled by the bombardment.

NAME and Poke, Step and the NAME and NAME poured out of the club like bees sallying forth to defend the hive. Around the corner of the building they raced, eager to detect the enemy. Prompt as they had been, however, they were too late. The night was very dark; there was much shrubbery about, which, even in its leafless state, afforded cover. The stone-thrower was gone. The boys could not detect a darker shadow betraying his whereabouts, and there was no sound of fleeing feet.

NAME and ORGANIZATION turned to the right, and the others to the left, spreading out as they neared the barn. The course taken by NAME and his comrade led toward the house, round which they worked their way as rapidly as possible. Strain their eyes as they might, they saw nothing to arouse suspicion; nor were they[142] better rewarded when they moved to the street, and peered up and down road and sidewalk.

“Clean get-away,” ORGANIZATION said reluctantly. “Fellow must have bolted just as soon as he let drive. And it mu"
38,"“Link—link in a chain?” Step repeated.

“Just that! A chain of meannesses! Listen!” And NAME went on to describe briefly, but forcefully, the persecution to which he believed he had been subjected. “And now we’ve had the stoning,” he added. “There is one explanation, and only one. NAME has dropped Step and taken me on. He hates me more for interfering than he hates Step for squabbling with him. And just as that’s the only explanation, there’s just one way to handle the case—and that’s for me to settle with NAME. And I will—don’t you worry!”

None of his hearers took his words lightly. All were ready to consider them very gravely. Here, indeed, was an issue for a youthful court of honor; and it behooves such courts, young or old, to pass judgment in all solemnity.

“Well, I guess you’re entitled,” said Poke slowly.

The others, with one exception, nodded assent. The NAME looked unconvinced.

“Talking about chains,” he remarked, “you mustn’t forget the old rule: the chain’s no stronger than its weakest link. And there is[152] a link that may be weak. I don’t say it is, but I do say it may be.”

“Rats!” snapped Step.

The Shark wheeled to face him. “Rats nothing! What’s the record—the school record—for the shot put?”

“What are you talking about?”

“The record. What is it?”

“Oh, thirty or thirty-five feet for the twelve-pound shot.”

The Shark frowned. “Confound it! but can’t you chaps make anything exact? ‘Thirty or thirty-five feet’! How’s anybody to make computations with all unknown quantities?”

“What are you trying to compute?”

The NAME juggled the stone, which he still held. “NAME! This weighs more than twelve pounds, I’ll bet—may run up to fifteen,” said he. “But what am I figuring on? Why, the amount of force required to send it through the arc this stone described.”

“Twelve to fifteen pounds!” jeered Step. “Seems to me you’re furnishing some of the unknown quantities yourself.”

[153]

“I am,” said the Shark. “I admit it. I also admit that I can’t reach satisfactory results from such data. But the results I do get—subject to revision, of course—make me doubt that NAME could have done the job. When I have the stone weighed, and when I measure the distance across the room, and add a good estimate of the distance the thrower stood from the window, I believe I can plot a curve——”

A chorus of shouts interrupted him. The non-mathematical members of the club would have none of such follies. Evidence? Wasn’t the cap evidence enough to convict Orkney?

Stoutly the Shark maintained that one should not put too great faith in circumstantial evidence.

“What! You’d put more in your old curves and calculations?” cried Step.

“Every time!” vowed the Shark.

NAME cut short the discussion. “Look here, fellows!” he said sharply. “I’m going to thrash Orkney, and there’s no more to be said about it.”

“Well, thrash ahead!” growled the Shark. “I don’t object to ORGANIZATION but I am pointing out that you may be wrong as to your reason for thrashing him.”

“I’ll risk that!” cried NAME hotly. “And I’ll even the score at the first chance I get.”

This decision, warmly admired and praised by the club, seemed to be in a fair way for accomplishment on DATE when NAME, walking alone to school, met Orkney at a street corner.

Meditation had cooled his anger, but had not lessened his determination to have a speedy accounting. He put himself in Orkney’s path, and gave him monosyllabic greeting.

“Huh!” It must be confessed that there was a distinctly challenging note in NAME’s growl.

“Huh!” responded Orkney. In fairness it is to be stated that he betrayed no sign of anxiety; and instead of halting, stepped aside and passed the boy holding the center of the walk.

NAME turned, and overtook him in three long strides. Then they moved on together, but with a space of three or four feet between them.

[155]

"
39,"NAME went on to the house, but only to find himself again in the rôle of defendant. The complainant this time was NAME, who swooped down upon him when he entered the kitchen. She caught him by the arm, dragged him across the room, and pointed tragically to a tub, in which were soaking several mud-stained garments.

“See all the trouble you’re makin’ me, you imp!” she cried. “How do you s’pose I’m a-goin’ to do all the work of this big house, with you snoopin’ round, and breakin’ my clothes-line, and lettin’ down half a wash into the dirt? All them things to be put to soak and done over! I tell you I just won’t stand it, I won’t! We’ll see, Mr. NAME, what your mother’ll have to say to such tricks!”

NAME wriggled free. “But, NAME, you’re[132] all wrong,” he protested. “I didn’t break the clothes-line.”

NAME sniffed incredulously. “Course not! Must have been NAME or the cat! Go ’way with you, tryin’ to bamboozle me with such talk!”

Poor Sam felt like throwing up his hands in despair, or bursting into vehement denials. But once more he was reminded of the stake for which he was playing.

“Honestly, NAME, I had nothing to do with dropping the wash,” he declared so emphatically that she could not but be impressed. “I didn’t even notice that you’d hung it out. And as for breaking the line——”

“Well, somebody broke it!” said NAME tartly. “Look at it!” And she snatched a coil of rope from a shelf above the tub.

NAME gravely inspected the parted strands.

“Well, it is broken, fast enough,” he began. “That is”—he was peering hard at the end of the line—“that is, it isn’t broken—I was mistaken; this has been cut.”

“What do you mean?”

“Cut with a knife—and a sharp knife, at[133] that. Made a clean gash. No accident there, NAME!”

The cook took time to make careful examination.

“My stars, NAME, but you’ve got a head on you, after all!” she declared. “Who’d ’a’ thought it! No; I don’t mean the head—it’s the miserable meanness of the job. But who on earth would be so ugly?”

“I don’t know,” said NAME. “Anyway, though, I’m not the fellow.”

“Well, puttin’ it that way, I don’t suppose you are,” NAME admitted. “But I’d give a pretty penny to be able to figure out who is.”

“So would I,” NAME agreed gravely."

44,"For an instant ORGANIZATION was abashed. “Why—why, there’s something in that. I guess I wasn’t thinking of our new name.”

“Well, NAME was,” said the Shark crisply.

“Huh!” grunted Poke. He glanced thoughtfully at NAME; seemed to be about to continue; changed his mind, and let the subject drop.

NAME went home that afternoon to find Lon in uncommonly bad humor. Somebody, it appeared, had opened a faucet in the barn, and left the water running in a merry stream. As a result, half the floor had been flooded, and annoying, if not heavy, damage had been caused. Lacking evidence to the contrary, NAME was disposed to hold NAME responsible.

[130]

“But I had nothing to do with it,” the boy explained. “I don’t know how it happened.”

“Foolin’ ’round here, wasn’t you, after school?”

“Yes—but I didn’t touch the faucet.”

“Guess you’re gettin’ absent-minded.”

NAME reddened wrathfully, but kept his head. Very clearly he realized that he had a deal at stake. A youth on probation, as he was, must shun rages as well as keep his record clean.

“Look here, Lon!” he said. “I’m not joking—I’m in earnest. And I tell you I’m not to blame. I mean it—honor bright!”

Lon rubbed his chin. “I swan, but it plumb beats my time! You’re sure you didn’t do it, and I’ll swear I ain’t been walkin’ in my sleep and cuttin’ up didoes for more’n a year. Yet here was the water goin’ like all possessed! Now, who set it goin’?”

“I didn’t,” said NAME decidedly.

“Hanged if I believe you did!” Lon had been studying the boy keenly. “You’ve got as much of Old Nick in you as the next ’ORGANIZATION, generally, but you have been NAME’ pretty[131] well lately. And you ain’t a liar any time. So it looks as if we’d got to add this to the list o’ mysteries, ’long with who struck NAME. Only I do wish I could lay hands on the skunk that made all this mess, and argy with him a while on the error of his ways.” And NAME frowned as he turned his gaze to the water-soaked planks."
45,"There was a long pause, and a very significant pause it was. The boys stared at the cap in Step’s hand; then they glanced from one to another. Here and there a head nodded, as if in answer to an unspoken question; but it was left to Poke to break the silence.

“Jupiter crickets! That settles it, I guess. Well, I never have liked NAME, but I didn’t think him up to this sort of thing!”

“Or down to it!” cried NAME.

“Now you’re talking!” chimed in the ORGANIZATION. “Lowest-down trick that ever was!”

“Trick! Huh! Worse than that!” growled Poke. “Why, that rock might have killed one of us!”

The Shark appeared to be estimating the weight of the stone. “Yes; it’s heavy enough,” he said calmly. “If it had struck anybody squarely, the result might have been fatal.”

[147]

There was a wrathful gleam in NAME’s eye. “Where did you find the cap, Step?” he demanded. “Let’s get down to business.”

“It was on the ground, back of the barn—low limb of one of the apple trees must have knocked it off his head. Great luck that I stumbled upon it; and that was just what I did. Too dark to see anything, but my foot caught in something, and I stopped and picked the something up. And here it is!”

Poke was wagging his head in his peculiar fashion. “Fellows, it’s as plain as day. Orkney has been too proud to wear the cap to school, but he didn’t mind putting it on at night, when nobody would notice it. Then he came sneaking around the club-house. The Shark must have had a glimpse of him at the window. When we went out to see who was there, he lay low. As soon as we came back into the house, he let drive the boulder at the first chance, and then bolted for all he was worth. He had such a start that he got away; but he didn’t dare stop to pick up the cap. And now, I say, we have him where we want him.”

“You bet we have!”

[148]

“That’s hitting the nail on the head!”

“Gee! but it was a cowardly job!”

So spoke the Trojan, Step and NAME. Poke warmed to his theme, after the manner of orators, encouraged by applause.

“We’ve got him where we want him, and we’ll put him through the works. I tell you, he’ll be mighty sorry before this thing is ended. Why, he ought to be arrested and sent to jail!”

“H-m-m-m!” It was a murmur tinged with disapproval, which ORGANIZATION did not fail to perceive.

“Wait a minute, fellows!” he said hastily. “I know what you’re thinking, and I guess you’re right. We can take care of this case ourselves. We will, too! If the club can’t defend itself, it ought to go out of business.”

There was another murmur, all approval.

“It may have been Step’s scrap in the beginning, but it’s our scrap now,” Poke went on. “It’s a club affair. That stone was thrown at the bunch—at NAME, for instance, as much as at Step.”

The Shark grunted. “Huh! Be accurate, ORGANIZATION, be accurate! It wasn’t thrown at Step[149] at all. He was out of range—across the room from the rest of us. He wasn’t in sight from the window.”

“Eh? What’s that?”

“It was the fact—come to think of it,” Step himself admitted. “I remember I’d left the crowd.”

“Humph! Don’t see that that makes any difference,” argued ORGANIZATION.

“It doesn’t—in one way,” said the Shark. “In another, it does. It means that the person who chucked that stone wasn’t especially after Step. No doubt he took a good look into the room before he let drive. And, as I recall the position of each of us, NAME stood where he must have been the real bull’s-eye of the target.”

“But what diff——”

The Shark did not let Poke finish the query. “The difference between getting things straight or crooked,” he rapped out. “How can you solve a problem——”

“Oh, hang mathematics!” Poke interrupted, in turn. “Cut ’em out! This isn’t a recitation; it’s a row! Let’s hear what NAME has to say.”

[150]

NAME had been keeping silent, but with growing difficulty. He was, as we know, naturally impulsive, and still a beginner in the practice of the policy of ORGANIZATION. Moreover, he was not a fellow of the sort to make ready excuse for attacks w"
46,"He had cause to repeat the statement in DATE. Things went wrong about the NAME place with peculiar persistence. Valuable young trees were broken down; gates, supposed to be kept closed, were found open; NAME, for whose care NAME was responsible, was missing over night and came limping home in the morning in badly battered condition. And in each instance it appeared to be incumbent upon the son of the house to prove his innocence. It is an old rule of the books[134] that there is much difficulty in establishing a negative proposition. NAME’s patience was sorely tried, but he kept his wits about him, remembered the demands of his situation, and did his best to win confidence by deserving it.

He had his suspicions, of course, that there was something more than mere coincidence in the succession of troubles. Also he had a theory as to their cause. In amateur fashion he undertook detective work. In other words, so far as he could, he maintained a close, if unobtrusive, watch upon the doings of NAME."
47,"“Link—link in a chain?” Step repeated.

“Just that! A chain of meannesses! Listen!” And NAME went on to describe briefly, but forcefully, the persecution to which he believed he had been subjected. “And now we’ve had the stoning,” he added. “There is one explanation, and only one. NAME has dropped Step and taken me on. He hates me more for interfering than he hates Step for squabbling with him.

NAME turned, and overtook him in three long strides. Then they moved on together, but with a space of three or four feet between them.

[155]

"
48,"The frown vanished. “Exactly!” said[114] Poke. “So, if we teach that dog to let feathers alone, he won’t bother many chickens—see?”

Step’s manner was slightly skeptical. “Oh, that’s easy to talk about, but, practically, how are you going——”

Poke didn’t let him finish the sentence. “Ever smell burning feathers? Well, I guess you have, all right! And don’t you think that if we tie a pail to his collar, and there are some burning feathers in the pail, Mr. NAME get enough of chickens to last him a lifetime?”

Step was a generous fellow; he didn’t grudge a friend a triumph.

“Gee, Poke, but you’re a corker! How’d you ever work that out? But I say! I can improve on the pail. Up in our attic’s one of those queer, old-fashioned lanterns with tin sides punched full of holes—like a colander, you know. And there’s a double chain to it—guess they used to hang it up outdoors. And there are snaps on the chain—might have been made for us. Only”—he paused an instant—“only how’re you going to be sure the stuff will burn?”

Poke smiled the smile of easy NAME] “Don’t you worry! A few rags soaked in kerosene, and stuffed in with the feathers will take care of that, all right!”

From this discussion and activities which followed, it happened that when NAME turned a corner near Mr. NAME’s gate he came upon his two chums engaged in friendly overtures to a large and somewhat suspicious dog. Poke, as he saw, had a tempting bit of meat, while Step held behind him a rusty contrivance of tin, from which loops of still more rusty chain depended.

“Halloo! What’s up?” NAME demanded curiously.

“Oh, first class in dog manners—that’s all,” responded Step lightly.

Poke whistled softly, and held the meat nearer the dog, which took a step forward, halted, eyed the tidbit greedily.

NAME, far from clear as to what was afoot and inclined to caution not only by his new resolves but also by acquaintance with other ventures of his friends, watched the proceedings dubiously.

“I don’t yet grasp what’s the game,” he remarked.

[116]

Poke was lavishing blandishments upon the dog, and extending the bait; so it was left to Step to make explanation."

"
53,"Memory of the successful raid by Mr. NAME’s big hound and its unhappy results rankled in the breasts of Poke and Step.

It was one thing, they agreed, to be joint victims of hard luck; but it was quite another thing—and a deal harder to endure—to behold the author of their misfortunes jogging about the streets, wholly unpunished for his misdeeds. Step even had a gloomy notion that the dog was plumper than usual, which, if well founded, was higher tribute to the nourishing qualities of the looted chicken than to the prevalence of even-handed justice, to Step’s way of thinking. This view, confided to ORGANIZATION, met ready acceptance.

“Sure thing! And there ought to be something we could do about it,” observed Poke.

“Oh, I’ll find a way to get even,” Step declared.

“How?”

[112]

“Oh, you wait, and you’ll see,” said Step darkly.

Poke, as has been related, had leanings toward philosophy. Now he meditated briefly.

“See here, Step!” he said. “If you’re going to get at this thing, you’d better get at it right. You ought to teach him a lesson.”

“That’s just what I’ll do!”

Poke shook his head. “No; you don’t get me. You’re thinking of letting drive a stone at him, or giving him a whipping, but what’d be the use? He wouldn’t know why you did it.”

“Huh! Guess he would,” growled Step.

“He wouldn’t,” Poke insisted. “That is, he wouldn’t unless you schemed out a way to remind him of the stolen rooster. There’s got to be something to make him see there’s a connection—get me?”

Step sniffed contemptuously. “What you want me to do? Make him a speech or send him a letter about it?”

“Neither,” quoth Poke calmly. “But unless you make him understand that he’s being punished for stealing, he’ll think you’re thrashing him out of pure meanness.”

[113]

Step rubbed his chin. “I suppose that’s so,” he admitted. “But how can you work it? How can you make him understand? I’m weak on dog-lingo, myself.”

Poke smiled, a little pityingly. “Listen, and I’ll tell you something I read DATE. There was a chap who owned a dog, and he was a bully dog, except that he would steal chickens. So the man tied a dead hen to his collar, and left it there till—well, till that dog didn’t want ever to see another one or get anywhere near it. And that’s my idea—something like it, anyway—for teaching the hound a lesson.”

Step began to take interest. “Gee, but you have got an idea there! Only, if there’s anything left of the chicken he stole, we don’t know where to find it. And——”

“Don’t need to!” Poke broke in. “Look here now! Say you’re dealing with chickens. What do you come to first?”

“Hen-house,” said Step promptly.

Poke frowned. “No, no! Wake up! You come first to the feathers.”

“Oh, that way? Yes!”"
54,"Orkney gazed straight before him. The sullenness of his expression may have been a trifle more marked than usual. NAME, studying him from the corner of an eye, decided that his enemy was merely playing a waiting game.

There was a moment’s silence. Then said NAME, very grimly:

“This thing has got to stop—see?”

The tone was more impressive than the words. Orkney stopped, and inspected the other coolly.

“Has, eh? Well, what might ‘this thing’ be?” he inquired.

“You know well enough!”

“Guess again. I don’t.”

“You do.”

A dull red showed in Orkney’s cheeks. “That’s the same thing as telling me I don’t tell the truth.”

“Does sound like it.”

“Mean to call me a liar?”

“Yes—if you say you don’t know.”

Orkney’s fists clenched; but NAME, warily watching, saw that the enemy kept himself in hand.

[156]

Again there was a pause. NAME broke it:

“There’s no use in your trying to put up a bluff. It won’t go. You understand perfectly what I mean.”"
55,"It was DATE evening, and ORGANIZATION was in full session. NAME, Step and Poke were gossiping about school affairs, and with them was NAME, a new member and a brother junior. NAME and NAME, otherwise known as “Trojan,” a recently admitted classmate, were playing checkers in a corner.

The Shark, who was human enough to have his little affectations, pretended to care not at all for the game, holding it to be a poor and trifling substitute for chess; but it was to be observed that he was doing his best to win. Moreover, when he did win, he chuckled gleefully.

“Hew-ee! You ought to have known that last move was coming,” he told his opponent. “But you gave me the opening, and then I had you.”

NAME laughed. “I’d have NAME] all about it if I could see around two corners at once as you do. Never mind, though! I’ll win yet. Set up your men, NAME.”

Poke strolled over to the players while they were ranging their pieces.

“Fellow who wears glasses like the NAME’s ought to be able to see everything,” he remarked idly. “All the same, NAME, you’ll notice he isn’t making out much about Orkney’s schemes.”

“Humph! What can NAME do?” objected NAME. “That row of his with Step is ancient history.”

“Sure! And the time for a come-back was right after the row,” chimed in NAME.

Poke wagged his head sagaciously. “Don’t fool yourselves!” said he. “Orkney is a sticker. He’s got it in for Step, and for NAME, for that matter. We haven’t had the last of the business, not by a long shot.”

“Hear that, eh, NAME?” asked NAME.

NAME rose from his chair, and crossed to the checker players’ corner.

“I heard it,” said he.

“Well, do you agree?”

“Yes,” said NAME brusquely.

[137]

For a moment nobody spoke. All his friends realized that he was taking the matter seriously.

“Why—why—you must have some reason, of course?” NAME ventured.

NAME hesitated. “Maybe it’s more hunch than reason.”

“But what gave you the hunch?”

“Oh, one thing and then another.”

“Huh! That sounds like some of my answers in history!” quoth Poke. “It’s specially like those I make when I’m meeting a total stranger of a question, and trying to be polite, if not communicative.”

The Shark wriggled in his chair; he was growing impatient to resume play.

“Your move, NAME!” he snapped.

“Wait a minute!” said his opponent. “NAME’s going to elucidate.”

“Well, things have happened and kept on happening,” NAME began; “things that can’t be explained exceptNAMEBut I say, NAME! What on earth’s the matter?”

NAME, who had turned from the table in disgust at the delay, of a sudden had uttered an exclamation and started to his feet.

[138]

“Speak out! What is it?” NAME demanded.

The Shark pulled off his spectacles; held the lenses to the light; inspected them closely; shook his head.

“No; they’re not clouded,” said he, half to himself. “Very curious, I do declare!”

“What’s curious? And what are you driving at?”

“Of course, it might have been a tricky reflection,” mused the Shark. “Or, maybe, it was just an optical illusion.”

NAME caught him by both shoulders. “Wake up! What are you talking about?”

“Then, again, the doctor tells me eye-strain works queerly sometimes"
56,"“Well, this world does see a heap of entertainin’ things, comin’ and goin’,” he observed. “Good scheme, too—keeps folks from ORGANIZATION’ and gettin’ as dull as ditch water. ORGANIZATION’s perkin’ up a lot because of the Major and his unknown party o’ the second part, as we’d be sayin’ if you and me was lawyers.”

Here Lon spoke within the truth. The town was making a DATE’ wonder of the affair; and what the town talked, the school talked, and the club.

NAME, so far as he could, kept out of the discussions; permitted his chums to speculate as they pleased; and watched and waited for the interest in the matter to wear itself out.

Oddly enough, NAME appeared to be following the same policy. He was about town as usual, doing odd jobs when work was unavoidable. No improvement was reported in his habits, but even in his cups his tongue was not loosed, so far as his feud with Major NAME and its recent development were concerned. He grumbled and made threats, to be sure, but he had been grumbling and threatening people for DATE; and from his incoherent[128] growls his cronies gained no information. If he had an inkling of the secret of ORGANIZATION woods, he was keeping it to himself.

Step’s quarrel with NAME seemed to have led to nothing, even in the way of reprisals. There was no second demand upon ORGANIZATION to recover the cap, nor was there formal notice that he should repay the owner for the seized property. In debates at the club the probability of the latter course had been stoutly upheld by ORGANIZATION, who developed such concern in the outcome that he made a searching expedition, from which he bore back tidings that the cap was not to be found where it had fallen. Step insisted this merely went to show that Orkney, when the coast was clear, had returned to the scene and regained possession of the cap, thus avoiding loss and “saving face.”

“But he’s wearing another bonnet,” Poke pointed out.

“Oh, that’s because he’s too stuffy to admit the truth,” Step declared. “He’s as stubborn as a mule—that’s the whole case in a nutshell.”

The club agreed with this opinion of Orkney[129] more heartily than it endorsed Step’s performance, which was held to be juvenile, albeit not without provocation. NAME’s interference was accepted with respect rather than warm approval. As Poke put it, somebody, sooner or later, would have to thrash Orkney; and Step might as well have tried his hand. Whereat the Shark spoke up from his corner.

“Say, that’s nice doctrine to be preaching at ORGANIZATION!”"
57,"“I don’t intend to entertain ORGANIZATION in a body.”

Step’s expression was bewildered. “Say—say, you ain’t crawling, are you?” he queried.

The suspicion stung NAME’s pride. “Crawling? Not on your life! I’m looking for NAME, and when I find him I’ll ask him to[169] walk back in the woods with me—he’ll know what for. And you can come along, and one or two of the others, but——”

The cloud vanished from Step’s brow. “Oh, that’s all right!” he said heartily. “Can’t have a mob trailing along, of course. But I say! There’s Orkney now—just shooting out from behind the point. He’s chasing one of the kids.”

NAME’s glance followed the direction of ORGANIZATION’s extended arm.

“Yes, that’s Orkney, fast enough. But what’s he doing?”

“Pestering the youngster!” snapped Step. “Can’t you see? And I declare, if it isn’t Little Perrine he’s worrying!”

NAME watched the swiftly moving figures, one short and slender, the other tall and stout. NAME, barely in the lead, seemed to be hard pressed, for he dodged frequently without being able to throw off his pursuer.

Suddenly Step cried out sharply: “The miserable bully! Look, NAME! he’s driving the kid right down to the dam, where the ice won’t hold him for a minute!”

“Confound it all!” fumed NAME. “Why[170] won’t people think of Safety First? Why won’t——”

There he broke off, aghast at the catastrophe he beheld, but Step’s voice rose shrilly:

“Great Scott! it’s happened! They’re in—both in!”

With appalling swiftness the ice had yielded beneath the weight of the two, and NAME, vanishing as if through a trap-door in a stage, had been followed almost instantly by Orkney.

Step started to the rescue, striking out wildly and shouting as he raced down the pond at top speed. NAME, about to join in the dash, checked himself. He knew well enough how the thin ice near the dam, once broken, would crack and crumble under even slight pressure. “Safety First!” was the thought which flashed upon his brain; safety not so much for himself as for the pair struggling in the wat"

"
60,"Almost every town has the misfortune to include among its residents a few persons perhaps best described as “undesirable citizens.” In the case of ORGANIZATION by far the most undesirable of these was NAME, ORGANIZATION, sot, brawler, and petty thief. On several occasions vigorous efforts had been made to rid the community of his presence; but NAME, unchastened by thrashings or jail sentences for robbing hen roosts or clothes-lines, persisted in turning up like the worst of bad pennies. There was, therefore, general satisfaction in the town when news spread that, at last, he had been caught in an offense so serious that ORGANIZATION reasonably could hope to be relieved of him for a term of DATE; especially as the irascible, determined and energetic Major NAME was directly interested in his prosecution.

Mr. NAME, returning from his trip to[62] Epworth, heard the news down-town, and brought it home with him. Across the supper table he discussed the matter with his wife, and found her quite of his opinion that a shining example should be made of NAME. The topic, in fact, fairly shared their attention with the annoying absence of the son of the house. NAME had not been home for dinner, Mrs. NAME announced; and now he appeared to have forgotten the supper hour.

“I don’t know what has come over the boy,” she said. “He went out right after breakfast, and nobody but NAME has seen him since. She says he came in about two o’clock and had lunch; and then went out again. I think you’d better talk to him seriously. He doesn’t understand how important it is to a growing boy to have his meals regularly.”

“Very well; I’ll take him in hand,” said the father.

Mrs. NAME gave a little sigh. “Ah! I feel, sometimes, as if NAME were growing away from me. He’s getting to be such a big fellow, you know. Now and then I can’t but[63] have my doubts that I’m capable of managing him.”

“Still, you’ve done very well so far,” her husband assured her. “NAME’s a pretty good boy, as boys go. I don’t happen to think of any other youngster for whom I’d care to exchange him. But if he’s getting beyond you—well, I’ll try my luck. Only”—he hesitated—“only, when I do, perhaps you’d better make it a strictly masculine session. I may have to lay down some rather rigid rules, and—well, it will be just as well not to have an over-merciful court of appeal too conveniently at hand. Send him to me when he comes in, and NAME and I will reach an understanding.”

So they arranged it; and so it came to pass that when NAME walked into the library—the clocks were striking eight as he entered—his mother, after gently chiding him for his tardiness, slipped out. The shaded light, by which his father was reading, left the ends of the room in shadow, and NAME lingered for a moment by the door. At last he came forward, halting directly in front of his father.

Mr. NAME looked up. “Well, young[64] man——” he began, but suddenly his tone changed sharply. “What in the world have you been doing, NAME? You look as if you’d been dragged through a knot-hole!”

NAME’s wan smile was more eloquent than his speech. “I shouldn’t wonder if I did, sir. I’ve been walking around and—and thinking.”

“Where have you been walking?”

“Around town, sir—up and down the streets—anywhere.”

“Thinking all the while?”

“Yes, sir; thinking hard.”

“Been alone?”

“All alone.”

“Umph!” said Mr. NAME.

NAME licked dry lips. “I’ve been thinking, and I’ve thought it out,—what I ought to do, sir. And—and I’m here to make a clean breast of things.”

The father studied the boy’s face for a moment. “NAME,” he said slowly, “NAME, I can see that you’re greatly exercised about something or other. What it is I don’t know. I had intended to have you on the carpet for being late for dinner and supper, but I’m[65] afraid this is something more serious. But whatever it is, I hope you’ll do just what you say you wish to do—make a clean breast of it.”

“And face the music!” There was a new note in the boy’s voice, a firmer note.

“That’s part of the game of life, NAME—if you play the game fairly and squarely.”

NAME drew a long breath, and made his plunge. “Father, you’ve heard about the arrest of NAME? They say he shot at Major NAME. Well, he didn’t—but I did!”

Mr. NAME bent forward; he was looking into the boy’s eyes, and the boy did not quail under his scrutiny.

“I don’t ask you if you’re in earnest, NAME. I know that you are. Go on!”

“I took your gun this morning, and went out to the Marlow woods. I’d been told there were deer there. I was crouching under some bushes, and looking across a hollow, when I saw something dark on the other side. It moved, and I fired. Then a man’s head showed. I didn’t recognize him. I was so scared that I burrowed deeper in the bushes—hid for a while, sir. Then I realized I ought to do something. So I crossed the hollow. I[66] found blood spots, but the man had gone away. It seemed as if he couldn’t have been badly hurt. Then I came home. I hoped I wouldn’t have to tell anybody, but—but now they’ve locked up NAME for what I did.”

“When did you learn of the arrest?”

“This afternoon.”

“And since then?”

“I’ve been thinking it over—fighting it out with myself, sir.”

Mr. NAME rose and crossed the room. He picked up the gun, threw open the breach, peered into the barrels.

“You fired only once?”

“Only once, sir. Here’s the empty cartridge.” NAME took the shell from his pocket.

Mr. NAME put the gun in its place, and went back to his chair. There was a little pause; then said he:

“You had your mother’s permission, did you, to take that gun?”

“No, sir,” said NAME.

“Or to go hunting?”

“No, sir.”

“Did you seek it?”

[67]

NAME shook his head. “She was out, and I—well, I didn’t wait for her to come home.”

“I see. By the way, were you under an impression that I had ever authorized such an expedition?”

“No, sir,” said NAME frankly. “But, then, you’d never forbidden it,” he added.

“There are several things it has never occurred to me to forbid you to do,” said his father drily.

NAME nodded. “That’s so, sir. I don’t think much of the excuse.”

“There we are of a mind. So you must have realized that you were doing wrong.”

“I didn’t bother—think, I mean—about that part of it; that is, I didn’t seem to comprehend how wrong the thing might be. Of course, I understood that it wasn’t exactly—exactly proper.” NAME had difficulty in picking the word, and did not appear to be over-pleased with his choice.

“Go on,” said his father. “Tell me just what you did when you reached the Marlow woods.”

NAME obeyed. Very carefully he went over the incidents of the morning. He ORGANIZATION] his cautious advance through the thick growth, his ascent of the first ridge, his discovery of the dark object across the ravine. In detail he explained how he had conquered his attack of “buck fever”; how he had taken aim and fired; how he had been overcome by consternation when the head of a man appeared. He did not deny that he had been slow in crossing the gully. In fact, he made no attempt to present his case in a more favorable light than it deserved.

Mr. NAME did not interrupt the story.

“NAME,” he said, at its close, “this is an extraordinary yarn of yours. It is borne out in part by the empty cartridge shell. I can see, too, that one barrel of the gun has been discharged. Also I am fully convinced that you have tried to present the exact truth about the shooting. I shall assume that the facts are as you have stated them. I don’t need to add that they make the case very serious.”

“I—I’m afraid it is, sir.”

“Yet you haven’t hesitated to make confession?”

NAME moved uneasily. “I—I—oh, but I did hesitate, sir. It was a hard pull to bring myself[69] up to the point. I guess I walked miles and miles before I was ready to come back and tell you everything.”

“I wonder,” said Mr. NAME meditatively, “I wonder if it occurred to you that you might run away from all the trouble.”

The boy reddened. “It did occur to me, sir. And—you may think it a funny way to put it, but it’s true—my legs just seemed to be determined to carry me down to the railroad station. And they did! I was there a long time, looking at time-tables.”

“But finally they lost interest?”

“Yes, sir. I’d reasoned it out that there could be no use in bolting; it wouldn’t help anybody.”

“It very seldom does help anybody, NAME.”

“I guess that’s so, sir.”

There was a long pause, which Mr. NAME ended.

“NAME, we’ve got to consider the next step—no doubt you have considered it; for it necessarily follows your statement. You’ve declared your faith, so to speak; now you’ve got to supplement faith with works.”

The boy nodded. “I know, sir. They’ve[70] locked up NAME. We—I, that is—have got to get him out; for he’s innocent.”

“Precisely.”

NAME could not repress a shudder. “He’s in the police station for something I did. When they release him, I suppose I’ll have to take his place. I don’t know much about law, but that would seem to be—er—er—to be——”

“Essential justice?” queried his father.

“That—that’s my idea, sir.”

“I see. But how do you plan to bring it about?”

Sam squared his shoulders. “By going down to the station and telling the officers what I’ve told you—everything. Then they’ll have to let NAME go. And they—they can keep me.”

“That would be a simple method; but there may be a better one—not so direct, but probably more effective.”

NAME stared at his father. “More effective?” he repeated.

“Yes. The officers might be slow to act. You have to remember that they think the case against NAME is pretty strong.”

“But they’d have to believe me,” NAME urged.

[71]

“Not so fast, son! Don’t forget that there is a good deal of circumstantial evidence against NAME. Your story would certainly create a doubt—and a strong doubt—in his favor; but with his reputation for evil doing, they would be reluctant to let him go and risk making a mistake. No; there is a surer way to achieve the result.”

“And that is——?”

“To go straight to Major NAME and give him your version.”

“Oh!” gasped NAME, and blanched at thought of confronting the redoubtable Major, by long odds the most terrifying, overbearing and truculent person in all ORGANIZATION. “Oh, I—I’d rather not, Father! They can put me in a cell if they want to, but——”

Mr. NAME rose to his feet. “We’ll go to the Major—at once!” he said, with decision."
61,"Major NAME lived in a big, brick house, made gloomy and forbidding by tall evergreen trees growing close to its walls. It had been, in DATE, one of the noted mansions of the town, and still maintained much of its former state. Its hedges were trimmed to a nicety; its graveled walks were straight of edge and free of encroaching grass; its lawn was the smoothest to be found for miles around; the brass rails beside the steps shone with frequent polishing. Yet, with all this care, there was something cheerless about the place, something suggesting an institution rather than a home. To his few cronies the Major admitted that he liked to keep his premises “well policed,” as he termed it, in memory of his army DATE; but the townspeople generally were of opinion that the verdict of a clever woman hit the case perfectly.

“Wonderfully kept up; marvelously well[73] ordered; excellent for everything—except comfortable living.”

Such was her summary. Perhaps nobody but the Major would have taken serious objection to it. He was quite sure that things were as he wished to have them; and it did not occur to him that anybody else was called upon to consider the matter.

This evening he was sitting alone in the big room he called his den, a room whose walls were lined with bookcases, gun racks and cabinets, and decorated with antlered heads of moose and deer. The pictures were few but good. Each hung as if its top had been adjusted with the aid of a spirit-level. The books on the shelves were like soldiers on parade.

The master of the house, seated before his open fire, curiously matched the room. He was very neat and precise in dress; he held himself stiffly, and after a fashion which caused careless observers to credit him with greater height than he possessed. As a matter of fact, he was rather short in stature and thin to gauntness; though it seldom occurred to anybody to speak of him as a little man.[74] Perhaps this was due to his domineering manner and striking face. The Major was a person to attract attention in any company. He had a shock of iron-gray hair, bushy eyebrows, a fiercely beaked nose, and a bristling moustache and goatee. His eyes were keen and piercing, and not often inclined to friendliness.

It need hardly be said that he was not on terms of intimacy with the youth of ORGANIZATION. Not that they ventured to annoy him—far from it! Two-thirds of the boys in town would cross the street to avoid meeting him, no matter how clear might be their consciences of recent offense against him. But the Major, striding along, swinging his cane and grumbling to himself as he advanced, was just the sort of figure to which peaceful folk involuntarily yield the crown of the way. And this evening, though he was not marching belligerently through the town, but was sitting before his cheery fire, he looked even more warlike—and war-worn—than in his public appearances. There was a patch of court-plaster on his cheek, and his left hand was wrapped in a bandage.

[75]

There was a deferential knock, and the door of the room opened. In stepped a man servant, severe of countenance. He advanced to the Major, and halting, stood at attention.

“Mr. NAME—to see you, sir,” he reported. “Yes, sir; Mr. NAME and NAME.”

The Major scowled. “What! NAME and that boy of his? What’s he here for? But show NAME in, of course. If the boy doesn’t want to come, don’t urge him. Perhaps he’ll wait in the parlor.”

But NAME, albeit he gladly would have lingered behind, was not to be permitted to escape his ordeal. With dragging foot he entered the den at his father’s heels, and stood unhappily clutching his cap, while his elders shook hands somewhat formally.

“Ah, Mr. NAME, glad to see you!” said the Major. “Be seated, I beg you. And come up to the fire. Chilly evening, sir; chilly, though seasonable.”

“Major NAME, permit me to present my son, NAME,” said Mr. NAME.

NAME stepped forward with a resigned hopelessness like that of a condemned criminal. He felt himself quailing before the ORGANIZATION] eye; but felt a surprising—and vaguely encouraging—heartiness in the grip the old soldier gave his timidly extended hand.

“NAME, I trust you are well,” quoth the Major, courteously enough. Then, not being impressed with the importance of minors in the scheme of the universe, he turned to the boy’s father, after suggesting to his youthful caller that he, too, take a chair near the fire.

Mr. NAME cleared his throat. “Ahem, ahem! NAME, I have been given to understand that you have been the victim of an unfortunate accident.”

“Accident!” The Major sat straighter in the chair in which he had just seated himself. “Sir, that’s misuse of English. What I was victim of was a most cowardly and scoundrelly attack. Thank heaven, though, the perpetrator of the outrage was at once apprehended and taken into custody.”

“You’re sure of the identity of the——”

The Major’s eyes flashed; he was guilty of the discourtesy of interrupting a guest.

“Am I sure? Sir, I am as absolutely certain of the miscreant as I am of this”—he touched the court-plaster on his cheek—“and[77] of this”—he waved the bandaged hand. “I’ve two good reasons to remember him, sir.”

“But, Major——”

“Pardon me a moment! You may not know, but it is the fact that the fellow has threatened, repeatedly, to do me harm. It’s an old grudge. DATE I was fortunate enough to be active in sending him to jail, and he’s never forgotten my modest service to the general welfare. DATE—on the public street, sir—he reviled me, and declared that he would have revenge. It was a fortunate warning, sir; for this morning, when he and I met in the woods—oh, yes; we passed within ten yards of each other—I took care to keep a weather eye open for just some such performance as he undertook. I’d kept his general bearings, and when he blazed away at me—why, sir, I rushed for him. And by NAME! I got him—as good as caught in the act, sir!”

“But not quite caught in the act, sir. There must have been an interval——”

The Major raised a hand. “Pardon me again! Sir, what you speak of is a trifle, a ORGANIZATION. And there was plenty of circumstantial[78] evidence—empty shell in the right-hand barrel of his gun—barrel fouled by the discharge. And he attempted no denial. Why, sir, he merely stood there and cursed me to my face, the scoundrel!”

“And yet,” said Mr. NAME evenly, “I fear you were—and are—in error.”

“Eh?” The Major bristled. “Eh? You fear I’m in error? Most extraordinary statement, sir! Do you mean to insinuate that nobody shot me?”

“I merely suggest that you may not have been shot by NAME.”

“But who else under the canopy could it have been?”

“I am afraid, as I told you—afraid that it was my son.”

“What!” Up sprang the Major. “Man, what do you mean? This boy?” He whipped about, and peered at NAME. “Why, he’s a mere child! Preposterous, sir; utterly preposterous!”

“I wish that it were!” said Mr. NAME, with feeling. “But the fact remains that he insists he was gunning this morning in Marlow woods; and that he declares that[79] he mistook a man for a deer, and fired at him.”

“Tush, tush! That’s all a piece of boyish imagination. He’s been reading dime novels! Haven’t you, young man?” And the Major shook a bony forefinger in NAME’s face.

“No, sir; I haven’t.” NAME spoke firmly, and his eyes did not fall before the Major’s.

“Do you expect me to believe you were the fellow who winged me?”

“Yes, sir.”

The Major went back to his chair. He dropped into it almost limply. “Out with your story, boy!” said he. “I’ll listen—I’ve got to, I suppose.”

The dreaded moment had arrived. NAME nerved himself to the task before him. The keen, old eyes under the bushy brows never left his face. He felt that they were penetrating every secret of his soul. But, after all, he had nothing but the truth to tell; and there was nothing he wished to conceal. Slowly at first, and then more rapidly, if not more easily, he reviewed the events of the morning. He dealt with his hunt through the woods; described the twin ridges and the valley[80] between. Then the Major broke in upon him.

“By NAME, boy, but you have the lay of the land pat!” he exclaimed. “Go over that again, please—about the bushes where you hid, and the others where you saw something move.”

NAME repeated this part of his story. The Major stalked to a closet, and stalked back, carrying a woolen cap, dark red in color.

“Was that what you saw?” he demanded grimly.

“It might have been—I’m not certain.”

The Major thrust a finger into a hole in the cap.

“That’s where one shot went through. But, by the great horn spoon, NAME! what’s a man to do to secure reasonable safety in the woods these times? I put on a red cap to warn gunners not to pot me for a deer. Have I got to wear sleigh-bells, or carry an automobile horn, to let ’em know it’s a human being that’s coming? I must say things are at a pretty pass, when anybody who wants venison has to take his life in his hand to get it!”

“Agreed!” said Mr. NAME. “That’s one[81] of the reasons why I’ve practically dropped hunting. But that cap, now—strikes me the red might not show very clearly among the dead leaves.”

“What I saw seemed to be dark rather than red,” NAME explained.

The Major pulled at his tuft of beard. “All most extraordinary and yet—queer how the thing might have happened, as the boy says. I’d half made up my mind that scoundrel was gunning for me; so, naturally enough, when that charge of buckshot came my way, I looked where I thought it probably came from. And the puff of smokeless powder isn’t much—it’d have been gone in a few seconds. And sound fools you on direction. Expecting attack from DATE, I’d be pretty sure to place the sound there, whether or no. And the boy declares he was right across the gulch? Umph!”

NAME resumed his account. He made confession to his fright; to the moments which passed before he dared to look at the farther ridge, even though he heard the loud crackling of branches.

The Major nodded. “That fits, too. Soon as[82] I could wrap a handkerchief about the bleeding paw I was off after NAME. But finally you crossed over to see what you’d bagged, eh? Umph! Why didn’t you run away?”

“I—I didn’t think I should.”

“Wanted to, didn’t you?”

“Indeed I did, sir!”

“Umph!” said the Major again. “Well, go on. What did you find?”

NAME described the trampled brush and the spots of blood on the leaves. Also he related his vain effort to follow the trail.

The Major was scowling fiercely. “That’s all, eh? Enough, too, I must say! No, it isn’t, either. Look here, young man! I suppose I must accept this story. You’ve just missed committing murder—yes, murder! Abominable recklessness, abominable! And criminal, highly criminal! You’ve rendered yourself liable to a heavy penalty. You’ll have to suffer——”

Mr. NAME spoke sharply and emphatically: “That is not at present under discussion. Our immediate interest is justice to a wrongly arrested man.”

Up went the Major’s warlike eyebrows.[83] “Eh? What’s that? Justice, you say?” Then he whipped about to NAME. “Boy, do you understand the situation in which you’ve placed yourself? Want justice done, do you? That’ll mean trouble for you. Don’t quibble! Why didn’t you let well enough alone?”

“Why—why, sir——”

“Umph! Your father’s responsible, of course, for your telling the story.”

Again Mr. NAME intervened. “Not so fast, Major. Of his own volition NAME told me what had happened. The affair was a complete surprise to me. It was my suggestion that he repeat his statement to you rather than to the police—and there my responsibility begins. But I’ll add that, as it has begun, I shall regard it as continuing until this matter is settled.”

“Eh?” The Major looked more hostile than ever. “Am I to accept that as a declaration that you are backing the boy?”

“You may accept it as meaning that while I regret deeply his rashness and its results, now that he has made confession, I’m backing him, as you term it—and I shall continue to back him.”

[84]

There could be no mistaking Mr. NAME’s earnestness and determination. A thrill shot through NAME. He flashed a grateful glance at his father; then turned to face the Major.

The countenance of the grizzled warrior offered a rare study in conflicting emotions. It betrayed anger, but it also suggested chagrin. Moreover, there was a hint of admiration. There was an instant in which NAME believed that the Major was about to attempt personal chastisement on the spot; there was another in which he wondered if the old man were not struggling with a sense of helplessness. Then, of a sudden, the Major laughed explosively.

“Ha, ha! By the great horn spoon, NAME! I’d do the same, if I stood in your shoes! Blood’s thicker than water, every time. Ought to be, by NAME! when it’s good blood. And it’s good blood that’s made your boy own his mistake and step forward, like a man, to bear the consequences. I hate a sneak, but I take off my hat to a real man, no matter whether he’s young or old. There, there! Hear me out! This thing came near enough to being my funeral to justify me in attending to NAME] arrangements. I’ll telephone to the police, and withdraw my charge against NAME; and I’ll keep my own counsel about why I withdraw it. That’s all right—accidents will happen, and when you’re satisfied a thing is an accident, there’s nothing to do but grin and bear it. Our young friend here can learn a lesson, and be more careful in future. No need for him to gossip about it, eh?”

NAME was speechless at this amazing turn for the better in his affairs; but his father came to the rescue.

“Major, you’re most kindly and generous. If there’s anything I can do, command me! If NAME threatens proceedings for illegal arrest you must permit me to guarantee you against loss in any way.”

The Major shook his head. “Very good of you, sir, but unnecessary—quite. NAME’s language was so abusive that a charge of noise and brawl would lie against him; and, no doubt, the officers will hold him overnight for safe-keeping, and turn him loose in the morning. And he’ll be content to drop the case, so far as the law goes; for he has no love for courts of any sort. But, young NAME] turned to NAME, and there was a wry grin curling his fierce moustache—“young man, you’ve robbed me of the consolation of being a public benefactor. If I could put that scoundrel behind the bars, at cost of a flesh wound or two, I’d count the pain as nothing compared with the service to the community.”

NAME found tongue. “I wish I could tell you, sir, how sorry I am for—for shooting you.”

Once more the Major laughed, and his hand fell, in friendly fashion, on NAME’s shoulder.

“Boy, I’ve been wounded four times,” he said, “but this is the first time the fellow who hit me has had the grace to apologize.”

64,"Directly in front of him a lively game of hockey was in progress. To the right, and safely removed from the rushes of the players, were boys and girls, skating singly, or in[166] pairs, or in long lines, hand in hand. To the left, near the dam, were a few youngsters.

NAME shook his head as he observed them. The ice always was thinner there than in other parts of the pond, and there was seldom a season in which somebody did not regret rashness in straying too close to air-holes. At a time like this there was more or less danger anywhere in the neighborhood of the dam.

“It ought to be roped off,” he told himself; but as there appeared to be no means to carry out this precaution he sat down on the bank and began to put on his skates. This he did leisurely, pausing now and then to run his glance over the skaters. At a little distance up the shore some of the larger boys were building a fire, and were having trouble, their fuel consisting chiefly of long boards torn from an abandoned ice-house. Here a little crowd clustered. NAME thought he had a glimpse of Orkney, but was not certain. As he tightened his last strap, however, and stood up, Step came along, arms and legs flying in an effort to recover the partly lost art of the Dutch roll. At sight of NAME the lanky youth went through some extraordinary contortions,[167] checked his speed, and glided alongside his friend.

“Say! It’s all right—he’s here!” was his greeting.

“Who’s here?” asked NAME, quite unnecessarily.

“Humph! Who you s’pose? Deacon Pender?”

“No,” said NAME coolly. “I don’t imagine you were thinking of the deacon.”

“You bet I wasn’t!” rapped Step. “I was thinking of NAME.”

NAME peered at the crowd by the fire. “Queer I can’t make him out,” he remarked.

“He’s down at the lower end—along with those kids.”

“Oh!”

Step was grinning. “Oh, he tried to butt into the hockey game, but the fellows gave him the cold shoulder. So he had to flock by himself till he saw the young ’uns. He’s with ’em now, teasing and tormenting ’em, I reckon.”

NAME struck out with the experimental feeling of one on runners for the first time in[168] DATE; made a wide circle, and came back to Step.

“Bit rusty, but I’ll get the swing all right in an hour or so,” he reported.

Step brought him back to the previous question, so to speak.

“What do you want? Don’t mean to fight him on skates, do you?”

“Certainly not,” said NAME testily. “What put such a notion in your head?”

“Well, what are you here for?” demanded Step pointedly.

“Don’t expect to have a fight before all this crowd, do you?”

“Seems to me you’re getting awful fussy.”

“I am, if ‘fussy’ consists in objecting to scrapping with half the town rubbering.”

Step looked hurt. “Don’t you want anybody but yourself to ha"
65,"It is not to be supposed that NAME, in spite of his exhibition of new self-control in the affair of Step and NAME, had taken on the gravity of DATE. There was, indeed, a change in the boy, but it was subtle rather than manifest. NAME worked a little harder than before, but played with no lack of zest. It was to be noted, however, that there was a decrease in the number of scrapes into which he fell.

Perhaps NAME, NAME’s bull terrier, was first to perceive, if not to understand, the change. NAME was a sagacious animal, beyond the follies of puppyhood, but still full of interest in the doings of his master and his friends; fond of a long tramp in their company; and very pleased to doze comfortably in a corner of the club room. DATE were much to NAME’s liking. NAME never had been cruel to him, but at times may have[125] been a bit thoughtless. Now, though, NAME enjoyed a degree of consideration quite unparalleled in his experience.

NAME, shrewdly observant, began to remark that NAME’s visits to the barn resulted in less disturbance of its orderly arrangements.

“Ain’t had a hedgehog day lately, have you, NAME?” he queried. “World don’t seem to be so all-fired uncomfortably crowded as it was, eh? And I dunno’s there’s so much genooine solace in kickin’ over buckets as a feller might think there was.”

“True enough, Lon,” said the boy soberly.

The hired man grinned cheerfully. “They say nobody has to hunt for trouble, and I guess there’s sense in that. Still, it’s amazin’ how often trouble’ll let you alone if you don’t go stirrin’ it up. There’s that wuthless scamp, NAME, now. He wouldn’t ’a’ been locked up over night if he hadn’t been so cantankerous. Course, they really took him in on suspicion, and I must say NAME is about the suspicionest nuisance that infests these parts. And all he got out of bein’ ugly was a sleep behind the bars.”

“That’s so,” said NAME.

[126]

“Funny how close-mouthed the Major is ’bout the whole business,” Lon went on. “If only he’d talk he’d make things easier for quite a lot of the chaps that was out gunnin’ that day.”

“Yes?”

Lon chuckled. “Te he! There’s always a ORGANIZATION bargain sale rush when the season opens, but DATE it was wuss than usual. Seems as if everybody was sort o’ venison hungry; so it turns out there’s about a dozen fellers who ain’t been able to prove what you’d call a water-tight alibi. That is, they can’t bring witnesses to show that they didn’t pot the Major; and they’re bein’ joshed half out o’ their lives, some of ’em. You see, first and last, a sight o’ folks must have been prowlin’ through Marlow woods that mornin’, and none of ’em happened to think to keep a time register. The huntin’ crowd’s all tore up about it.”

“No doubt,” said NAME. If he had cared to meet NAME’s eye, he might have noted a twinkle, suggesting that the hired man had theories of his own as to the identity of the careless sportsman. But NAME avoided NAME’s gaze, and NAME chose not to make direct inquiry."
66,"“I understand that you’re looking for trouble,” said Orkney slowly. “That’s nothing new with you and your crowd—you think you own the earth, and you’d like to fence in this part of it for your own stamping grounds. You had things your own way till I came along, and you’ve always been down on me because I wouldn’t tail on after your procession. You’d rather interfere with me than eat, any of you. Why, just the other day Step Jones——”

“Leave Step out of this!” NAME interposed. He had not been able to reconcile himself wholly to Step’s performance; and Orkney having found a weak spot in his armor, his tone was more belligerent than ever. “You’re dealing with me and not with NAME this time. And Step doesn’t beat dogs, and cut clothes-lines, and heave rocks through windows.”

“Well, who does?”

“You do!” roared NAME.

[157]

Orkney pulled up. He faced his accuser, and his eyes did not fall before NAME’s.

“NAME, you’re talking like a wild man,” he said.

“Wild, am I? Not much! I’ve got proof!”

Orkney shrugged his shoulders. “It’s plain enough you’re looking for a fight, and don’t care how you get it. Now, I tell you, in the first place, that all this stuff you’re hinting and insinuating is gibberish to me; and in the second place that if you want fight I’ll give you all you’re looking for and more, too.”

“Now?” demanded NAME.

“No,” said Orkney, and grinned a queer, savage grin. “What’s more, you know why I won’t fight now. It’s my day to speak for the NAME prize, and a pretty chance I’d have for it, wouldn’t I, standing up before the school with a black eye or a cut lip? You talk about bluffs! Where’s there a bigger bluff than asking a fellow to fight when you know he can’t take you on? Or maybe this is your game: You’re scheming to batter me up so that one of your gang can carry off the NAME, eh?”

“I hadn’t thought of the prize-speaking!”

[158]

“Well, I’ve been thinking of it for some time. And I don’t propose to let you ruin my chances.”

NAME fell back a pace. There was an element of reason in the other’s contention, which he could not ignore.

“Well, if I let you off now——” he began.

Orkney’s grin was sardonic. “‘Let me off’ is good, but we’ll also let t"
67,"“It’s that chicken business. We’re going to get even—teach him a lesson, I mean.... Got a scheme, a crackerjack scheme. Just you keep your eyes peeled.”

“They’re peeled, all right, but——” NAME hesitated an instant. “I say, you fellows, better not get in trouble. Remember, you belong to ORGANIZATION!”

“Huh! No chance of trouble—for us!” Step insisted. “Look here, NAME!” He displayed part of the chain with a snap at the end. “Two just like this—see? Well, we’re going to pass one of ’em around the dog’s neck, so-fashion.” In illustration he wound the chain about his own left wrist and for good measure took an extra turn. “Then we fasten it.” Another illustration, the rusty spring of the catch being moved with some difficulty. “Then, having fixed it so he can’t get rid of it, we——”

There Step broke off, for good and sufficient reason. For things were beginning to happen,[117] and the procession of events was moving with startling speed.

The dog, sacrificing caution to appetite, came within ORGANIZATION’s reach; whereupon ORGANIZATION, dropping the meat, caught the hound as he tried to gobble up the bait; deftly slipped the second chain about the animal’s neck, successfully worked the snap at the first attempt; wheeled; whipped out a match; struck it, and lighted a rag protruding like a fuse from the old tin lantern, which had been brought from behind Step’s back, as that youth gave NAME an object lesson.

The kerosene-soaked rag flamed fiercely; almost instantly, dense black smoke began to pour from the holes in the lantern. Poke, who had been busy with the contrivance and the dog, with never a thought of complications involving his comrade, sprang back with a shout of glee, which perhaps added somewhat—though increase was scarcely needed—to the terror of the hound, which gave a panic-stricken howl and a tremendous bound.

Step, who had been tearing desperately and quite vainly at the chain about his wrist—the rusty catch stuck as if it had been soldered—was[118] caught off his balance; dragged forward and into a run, which, under the circumstances, he could not check. The big dog, as heavy and powerful as many a sledge-team leader of the Far North, bolted wildly, yet with a general purpose; and this purpose being to seek asylum from the infernal machine at his heels, he dashed through the gate and toward the house, Step following, willy-nilly, his long legs flying and his long arms going like the arms of a windmill in a gale; while dangling from the chain between dog and boy, the old lantern emitted great volumes of choking smoke of most evil odor.

“Say, Step, where you going?” shouted the bewildered ORGANIZATION, who was still unaware of the difficulty in which his chum was involved. “What’s the matter? The pair of you look like an engine going to a fire!”

Now to this Step, for perfectly good reasons, made no reply. And Poke, seeing that NAME was running after his friend, joined in the pursuit. So the procession swept up the drive, turned a corner of the house, and headed for the side porch, under which the dog had a den of his own, entrance to which[119] was secured by a break in the latticework. Through this opening he shot with a final tug of such violence that Step was jerked forward, falling on his knees, with his head close to the barrier. And as by this time his fright fairly matched the dog’s, and as he fell to shouting for help as lustily as he could against the odds of the suffocating smoke, which poured through the lattice, and as the dog was howling more madly than ever, it may be imagined that there was a pretty to-do under and about the side porch of the ORGANIZATION house.

NAME and ORGANIZATION, naturally enough, tried to drag Step back from his most unpleasant position; but the dog had braced himself, or the chain had caught on some obstruction, so that the only result of their endeavors was to pull Step’s knees from under him, drop him flat on his stomach, and leave him, if anything, rather more helpless than before. Moreover, the cook came hurrying from the kitchen and the hired man from the barn; and jumping to the conclusion that where there was so much smoke there surely must be fire, both dashed buckets of water with better intention than aim. Very little of the water passed through[120] the lattice; a fair share of it spattered NAME and ORGANIZATION, and a great deal drenched the unhappy Step."

72,"The cook ran back to the kitchen for a fresh supply; but, luckily, the hired man, sighting the chain extending from Step’s wrist, laid hold upon it, and tugged with all his strength, and the dog, recognizing his voice, changed tactics, and charged from under the porch, bounding over the prostrate Step so swiftly that he turned a complete somersault, when the chain tautened again. The old lantern, still smoking voluminously, fell between boy and dog.

“Jee-rusalem!” gasped the hired man in bewilderment.

“Sa-sakes alive!” quavered the cook, who had reappeared with a freshly filled bucket.

Poke began to laugh hysterically; but NAME kept his wits. He caught the bucket from the woman’s hand, and plunged the lantern into the water. There was a long, hissing sound, a final puff of steam—and then comparative peace.

Step sat up. The dog, trembling like a leaf and whining weakly, crawled to the[121] hired man. From the vantage ground of the porch the cook spoke wonderingly and reprovingly:

“Well, I vum, but you boys do beat my time! What on earth do you think you’re up to? Playin’ horse with poor Hector there?”

“No—not a bit; ’twasn’t that at all!” protested Step.

The cook sniffed. “Feathers—burnin’ feathers! I can tell ’em every time! But what’s your notion in puttin’ ’em in that thing?” And she pointed at the ancient lantern.

Step got upon his feet. He fumbled at the chain at his wrist; and, by an irony of fate, the old catch now gave at a touch. Step rubbed the flesh into which the links had sunk. He tried to summon a propitiating smile.

“Oh, the feathers?” he said very mildly. “Oh, yes; the feathers. Why—why, we—we thought Hector there—he—well, he ought to know about ’em.”

“Land o’ love! but the boy’s crazy!”

The hired man scratched his head. “Must say it looks like it, NAME. Still, I dunno—boys’ll[122] be boys. And this young man acted ’sif he was willin’ to learn same time NAME did. They were sharin’, and sharin’ alike, on the smudge-pot, te he!”

Step scowled, but Poke burst into a roar of laughter, which eased the situation. The cook chuckled; NAME smiled. The hired man smote his thigh with his hand.

“Gee-whillikens! but I never saw the like of it! And I guess no great harm’s done. Don’t seem to be no fire under the porch.”

Then Poke found tongue. “It’s this way: The dog stole a chicken, and got us into a scrape. We thought we’d—er—er—we’d teach him a lesson and sicken him of stealing. And feathers and chickens go together—and—er—er—get the idea, don’t you?”

“Sorter!” grinned the hired man. “Kind o’ think I do, sonny. And t’other fellow got tangled up, somehow. Wal, yes, I do see how ’twas.”

“Then, if you don’t mind, we’ll be going home.”

The hired man waved his hand. “I would, if I was you,” he said. “I’d go home and get into some dry clothes.”

[123]

The three friends moved down the drive, with Step, a truly disconsolate and melancholy figure between the other two. For a little none of them spoke. It was left to Poke to break the silence with one of his bits of philosophy.

“You’ve got to live to learn,” quoth he. “Now, who’d have thought—no use, though, crying over spilt milk! And what on earth made Step want to chain himself up—no; we won’t talk about that, either. But I say, NAME, I tell you there’s a lot of sense in that notion of yours! Safety First for me after this—yes, sir; Safety First every time!”"
73,"NAME, following his enemy at a more moderate pace, was burdened by a peculiar sense of helplessness. He was troubled by no doubts of the justice of his cause; but he was annoyed and perplexed by the obstacles NAME threw in his way. They were the harder to consider philosophically because he was quite sure that he was obeying his new rule of ORGANIZATION, and that Orkney’s guilt was clearly established. At the same time he had to admit that NAME had offered valid grounds for delaying combat. Altogether the case struck him as one of difficult application of entirely sound principles.

As he turned a corner, however, he forgot Orkney for a little; for within a dozen yards of him he beheld two men in conversation. And one of the men was Major NAME. The other was NAME.

NAME almost halted. He gazed in surprise at the two. The Major had never appeared to[160] be straighter, or fiercer, or more bristling; while NAME’s slouch was never more pronounced. The ne’er-do-well was listening sulkily to the Major’s very energetic remarks, occasionally growling a brief reply to the veteran.

As it chanced, NAME had not met the Major since the night he had made confession. A glance was enough to show that he had nearly recovered from the effects of his wounds; and the ear testified that the vigor of his speech was in no wise abated.

After a second’s hesitation NAME advanced. As he neared the men, NAME, seeming, of a sudden, to catch sight of him, wheeled and shuffled off, growling as he went. The Major swished his cane, as if he regretted that it might not descend upon the retreating legs. Then he, too, saw the boy, and the severity of his expression lessened a trifle.

“Ah, young man!” he said. “Ah, good-morning!”

“Good-morning, sir,” said NAME.

The Major tapped the sidewalk smartly with his cane. “I’m out of hospital. Am I to regard myself as in receipt of your felicitations?”

[161]

“’Deed you are, sir!” NAME assured him with unfeigned warmth.

The Major’s eyes twinkled. “Mutually satisfactory state of things, eh? I’m pleased myself. Fact is, I’m so overflowing with good will this morning that I’ve been trying to improve that vagabond.”

“Yes, sir,” said NAME.

“By NAME! but I fancy I made it clear even to his befuddled wits that there is no profit in persistently remaining a social liability. I warned him that if he didn’t mend his ways he’d end in state’s prison. Big, hulking brute like that’s liable, some time, to commit a felony.”

NAME glanced at the retreating NAME. The fellow was big and hulking, and brutish as well—an ugly customer, in short.

“Has he been bothering you again, sir?”

“No,” answered the Major. “I rather anticipated some of his characteristic attentions, but he has quite neglected me. Not that I complain—certainly not! Only I took occasion to point out to him the exceeding unwisdom of again annoying me. Odd, too, how he took the advice. Leered at me, and mumbled,[162] but made no distinct threats. But I must not detain you, young man. You, I infer, are on your way to school?”

“Yes, sir,” said NAME again.

“Then proceed. A moment, though!” The Major’s bushy eyebrows met in a frown, which wholly lacked ferocity. “Your holidays are at hand, I believe. DATE, when you’re at leisure, I should be glad to show you my modest collection of weapons of war and the chase. Ought to interest you, as a budding sportsman with a promising record of large game!”

The Major’s eyes were twinkling once more. NAME blushed hotly.

“I’ll be very glad to come, sir,” he said.

“Then I have the honor to wish you a very good morning,” quoth the Major; and they parted in friendly fashion.

Both Major NAME and NAME soon lost first place in NAME’s consideration. The school session promptly put the Orkney affair to the fore.

The NAME prize for declamation was one of the great honors of the course, and competition[163] always was keen. The contest covered a full term, two boys and two girls entering the lists each DATE. Usually they were seniors, elocution being part of the required work of DATE, but sometimes juniors volunteered, often with a notion of “working off” the requirement ahead of time, but occasionally with a hope of winning.

There could be no doubt that NAME did his best to win. As it happened, he was fortunate in his competitors. The other boy was a senior, who took the platform simply because he had to take it, and who raced through his selection with an eye single to ending the ordeal in a minimum of time. Then two girls performed conscientiously but ineffectively. And then came Orkney, junior and volunteer.

NAME had chosen an ancient favorite “speaking piece,” so ancient, indeed, that a giggle ran through the hall when the principal announced, “The Parting of Marmion and NAME.” But the merriment quickly died, as the boy swung into NAME’s stirring verse.

“Good work!” was the involuntary and whispered tribute of ORGANIZATION, who sat beside[164] Sam. “Awfully good work, confound him!”

NAME nodded. Orkney was revealing unexpected dramatic fire; and, unpopular as he was with his audience, was capturing its admiration. One might suspect that he had had professional coaching, but one could not deny that it had been worth while.

There was loud applause—not the customary ripple of hand-clapping but a spontaneous and hearty demonstration—and NAME was smiling when he made his bow to his schoolmates, and another bow to the principal, and came down the steps from the stage. It was not a pleasing smile, for there was in it more than a trace of supercilious triumph.

“Hang the chump! Look at the smirk of him!” complained Step.

NAME made no answer. Orkney was approaching, and for an instant the eyes of the rivals met. NAME’s expression did not change, but the other’s smile lost the little charm it had. NAME found it bitterly taunting; it seemed to say to him, “This was what you schemed to prevent, eh? Well, you didn’t do it, did you?”

[165]

Step drove an elbow into his ribs. “You can’t spoil that mug by pounding it! Say, though! When are you going to get at it?”

“Soon as I can,” said NAME simply.

“Date with him?” whispered Step eagerly.

“Not exactly.”

The classes were rising to march out of the hall, but Step found time to make a suggestion.

“Maybe you can catch him down at the pond this afternoon. They say the ice is at last strong enough to hold.”

“I’ll be there,” NAME promised.

Mild as the season had been, the temperature had been falling steadily, if slowly; and the skim of ice on the big mill-pond on the outskirts of ORGANIZATION had thickened until it had been for DATE in rather perilous use by venturesome skaters. Now, however, NAME believed it was reasonably safe; and when he descended the slope to the pond, its surface was dotted with swiftly gliding figures."

90,"My backpack weighs 31 pounds, and it barely fit into the trunk of NAME and NAME’s ORGANIZATION. I don’t think they believed I was actually going through with this until I called and asked for a ride up the mountain. NAME gave me that look, that pitying, tight-lipped smile, but she helped NAME and I load up my things, and then they bought me lunch before dropping me off at the trailhead. NAME cried, and NAME gave me a can of pepper spray and an awkward side hug.
So here goes nothing. I’m at Springer Mountain, ORGANIZATION, with zero miles down and only 2,190 miles to go.
See you on the other side.  
Mile 8
I can feel my heartbeat in my feet, but I made it to the first campsite. I’m exhausted, but in that good I-did-a-hard-thing kind of way. I had trouble setting up my tent—broke a nail just getting it out of the bag—but there was another group at the campsite and some nice college kid saw me struggling, jogged over to help, and then had the whole thing up in under a minute. He looked at me funny, and I’m sure he was wondering what I was doing all the way out here instead of lounging on my sofa with a glass of chardonnay and an NAME’s book club novel, but he didn’t pry.
Mile 19
Well, I pooped in the woods DATE. You would have laughed at me as I hunted for the perfect spot, then deposited and buried my own waste like some dainty, purebred housecat.
I laughed at myself too.
Mile 49
I’m already behind schedule. I wasted hours repacking my bag DATE to redistribute the weight, as one hiker told me it would be less strain on my back to move the heavier items to the center. So I took everything out and repacked it as tightly as I could, which took forever. The hiker hovered nearby the entire time, obnoxiously commentating on all my belongings, and when he finally left, I sat down to write, only to find I’d somehow buried my journal. So, I unpacked my whole bag again, rummaging through my gear like a madwoman, just to then see the journal had been sitting on a rock next to me the whole time.
Even in the cold spring air, I was red-faced and sweating.
Mile 65
My feet are killing me, but I think I’ve finally broken in these fresh-out-of-the-box hiking boots.
I fell asleep last night listening to the crickets and thinking about you.
Mile 87
I met an interesting hiker DATE who said this was his second thru hike. He looked DATE older than me and called himself “NAME.” All skin and bones with a long scraggly beard, he looked like a castaway stranded in the woods, though I got the sense he liked the solitude. He’d jutted out his bearded chin at me and said, “Nobo?”
“What?” I huffed out.
“North bound?”
“North bound? Oh. Yes. I am.” I had to pause and catch my breath after each sentence. “Just getting started.”
He looked me over and clicked his tongue. “You’re carrying too much weight.”
I was momentarily offended before realizing he meant my pack. “How?! I left so much behind. I need all of this.”
He was quiet, chewing his lip. “Give it a few more miles. You won’t feel that way then.”
We continued walking; his stride was twice that of mine, but he slowed and matched my speed, and we hiked in companionable silence until I stopped for lunch.
He kept walking. “When you’re ready to let some of that go, you’ll feel much lighter. Trust me.” Then with a final, “take care out there,” he disappeared around the next bend.
His reprimand irritated me, but the frustration kept me going for a good four or five more miles.
I envied him: so confident and free.
He reminded me of you.
Mile 112
I pulled eight ticks off my legs DATE. There were probably more where I couldn’t see them, and that thought kept me awake all night, tossing and turning and twitching in my tent until the exhaustion pulled me into fitful sleep. I dreamt that my hiking boots jumped off a cliff, and I had to walk the rest of the trail with my feet covered in orange plastic ramen noodle wrappers.
Mile 148
I met some thru hikers from ORGANIZATION (which I had completely forgotten was a state) who were both in their 80’s! We talked the whole way, and it helped the miles pass quickly.
They told me the secret to longevity is to never stop moving.
Mile 162
I’ve been making better time; DATE was my record so far—14 miles. A rather uneventful 14 miles, though I did see a porcupine, which was interesting. I always thought they’d be…spikier…?  
At the shelter, I removed three shirts, a book, and a tube of lotion from my backpack and left them in a giveaway box. It made a surprisingly noticeable difference.
Mile 169
Well, those 14 miles about killed me. I slept late today, then took two ibuprofen before even getting out of my tent. My back hurt, my feet hurt—even my earlobes hurt.
The last thing I wanted to do was put those boots back on my swollen feet and walk.
Mile 202
Regret tastes sour and so do the dry ridges of my dehydrated gums.
What am I even doing out here?
Mile 327
I hiked 18 miles DATE but took DATE off. I needed to replenish my food, as I guess there’s going to be a good stretch before I reach another town (I’m still learning how to read maps and plan ahead). I bought groceries and some new clothes, as my pants are starting to hang on me, then checked into a motel and took the first real shower I’ve had since leaving ORGANIZATION. I stood there until the water ran cold, then laid down on the sheets and passed out until my grumbling stomach woke me up. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza and ate the entire thing myself.
Then I called the pizza place back and ordered another one.
Mile 463
Made it into ORGANIZATION. It’s been raining for DATE. The trails are slush, my boots are filthy, and I feel like a wet rag.
I want to go home.
Mile 567
I made a small group of friends who have sort of pulled me into their circle and let me tag along the last 50 miles or so. Melons is a vet tech from ORGANIZATION, whose cleavage makes introductions before she does. NAME is a lanky DATE who wears his pants rolled at the ankles and hikes in crocs. Seems impractical to me, but he says it’s comfortable. Aunt NAME is a hulking middle-aged Norwegian man who loves breakfast food and lugs around a flat top campfire griddle. He’s made us pancakes almost every morning, and it’s become one of my favorite parts of DATE. Easily the largest man I’ve ever met, Aunt NAME often smacks his head on low hanging branches as we hike, eliciting a string of game-like sound effects from ORGANIZATION like “doink” and “boing.”
Their company has changed everything, and I’ve laughed more in DATE than I have in DATE.
Mile 653
DATE was HARD. The terrain was rugged and uneven. I made a game, tracking how many hours ago I could go without tripping.
I never actually made it a whole hour.
Mile 713
Melons, NAME, and Aunt NAME decided to take a detour; NAME’s family lives nearby and invited everyone to stay for DATE, but I wanted to keep going.
We all exchanged contact information, then parted ways.
Mile 806
You don’t feel the blisters until you stop.
Mile 878
I’m tired of hearing my own breathing, tired of TREES, tired of freeze-dried soup, tired of having nothing but time to think about everything I should have done differently in my life.
I don’t know who I thought I was, why I ever thought I could do this.
Mile 900
I almost quit DATE, and then I met an angel.  
I was 7 miles into DATE, feeling like there was no possible way I could make it to the next shelter, nevertheless all the way to the tip of ORGANIZATION, when I walked straight into a spider web, tripped over a rock, then faceplanted in a patch of ferns. I was so angry, I hurled my backpack against a tree, pulling a back muscle in the process. Then I sat down and just sobbed.
Everything hurt; I was sunburned, hungry, and ready to call it quits and admit to the world that I couldn’t do it.
Then the next thing I knew, I was on my back, staring up at the floppy, wet tongue of a gigantic Great Dane. I struggled to sit up, and when I did, it nuzzled its massive head into my shoulder, and without thinking, I draped my arms over its neck. I realized then it was the closest thing I’d had to an embrace since NAME’s stiff-armed goodbye hug.
Shortly after, I heard someone whistling and calling for “NAME,” then saw a gray-haired woman heading down the trail. She took one look at me—at my pack thrown into the ferns, my scraped-up knees, and her dog (which was indeed named NAME) with its head on my shoulder—then looked me right in the eye and asked if I liked lasagna.
She introduced herself as “Zippy” as we walked a side trail up to her place. I could smell oregano before I saw the cabin. She’d made two bubbling-hot pans of the best lasagna I’d ever had and never asked if I wanted seconds of anything, but just continued to load food onto my plate the second I’d cleared it.
After dinner, we sat on her couch and talked about the hike—the solitude, the friendships you make, and the boredom too. I’d gone DATE without really talking to anyone and when she asked why I was doing it, it was like a dam broke within me, and I cried—ugly, shaking sobs that rattled our teacups on the side table. She let me cry, let me talk.
I told her that hiking the AT was never my dream, that I never wanted to put my life on pause to traipse up and down mountains and live out of a backpack for DATE.
Then I told her about you—how this was always your dream, your adventure, how you begged me to hike it with you…bought me my own gear and everything…because I had told you I would.
Then I told her how every time you brought up the hike, I shut you down—put you off with a “maybe DATE,” and “things are so busy with work right now,” or “how about when we retire.”
How naïve I was to think time would wait for us; sometimes hearts stop beating, and they never start up again.
I know I can’t blame myself for that, but I blame myself for giving you the false hope that I’d join you when I never had any intention of looping my arms through that purple backpack you hung in the garage next to yours. You waited for me, and now it’s too late for you. We should have been doing this together, and now you’ll never have the chance.
This hike has been hard—the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life, but you would have loved every minute of it. And I would have loved to do this with you.
I felt lighter DATE than I had the whole trip. Even with a belly full of lasagna.
Mile 989
How am I STILL in ORGANIZATION?
I left a multitool, some too-big hiking shorts, and an extra flashlight in a shelter box.
Mile 1057
This muggy dog-breath DATE air is making my skin crawl…
I dropped the gasket of my water filter in a creek DATE and stood staring into the brown trickle for several minutes trying to find the thing before I realized I was standing about a foot away from a coiled-up copperhead. My blood turned to ice—a momentary reprieve from the suffocating heat—and then I spun myself away from the thing with the agility of a woman DATE younger.
So, I didn’t get bitten by a snake, but I never did find that gasket.
Mile 1132
You wouldn’t believe who I ran into DATE: Melons, NAME, and Aunt NAME.
I must be that slow of a hiker.
Melons gave me a big hug, squished me right in between her giant bosom. NAME was wearing real boots—said he’d lost his crocs in a river and had to walk a mile and a half in socks before he could buy new shoes. Someone made NAME an apron with a picture of a giant backpacker flipping pancakes. He said he wears it every morning.
Mile 1281
Almost through ORGANIZATION.
I know I’ve complained a lot, but DATE was one of those days where all the blood, sweat, and tears felt like they were worth something. I woke up before sunrise, made hot coffee, and climbed to an overlook where the valley stretched below, still shrouded in shadow. I watched the sun rise and shed light on each curve and dip of the land. Birds chirped all around me, leaves danced in the breeze, and I felt you there with me.
For the first time, I couldn’t wait to get moving.
Mile 1359
Did I tell you I’ve been given a trail name?
Scribe.
Mile 1422
We’ve made it to ORGANIZATION! Melons and I hitchhiked into town DATE and got pedicures, mostly just to see the looks on the beautician’s faces when they saw our feet (that and I was dying for a foot massage). I picked out some bright red nail polish and sunk down into a massage chair, but when I peeled my socks away, my left pinky toenail came clean off and landed right in the sudsy water.
I didn’t feel a thing.
The poor lady painted the nail-less stub of my toe anyway, and now you can hardly tell anything is missing.
Mile 1614
The terrain has been fairly steep DATE but absolutely gorgeous. We’ve made it into ORGANIZATION, and the gang and I stopped for a much-deserved night at a motel. The motel served scrambled eggs at the continental breakfast the next morning, and between the four of us, we must have eaten two dozen eggs. Aunt NAME wasn’t impressed with their pancakes, but he still ate enough for a football team.
Mile 1736
I’ve made it to ORGANIZATION. From ORGANIZATION. WITH MY OWN TWO FEET. I can hardly believe it. There have been so many days when I’ve wanted nothing more than to give up and go home, but now that I’m getting close to the end, I’m almost afraid. What happens when it’s over?
Mile DATE
I beat my own record and walked 24 miles DATE. Every muscle in my body is screaming, and I barely have the energy to hold up this pen, but I just had to say one thing: I’m sorry.
I’m sorry you never got to see what I’ve seen or walk where I’ve walked, but I hope you know that I have carried you with me every step of the way. I know it doesn’t change anything, but wherever you are, I hope you know that you are what has pushed me through these mountains.
Mile DATE
We’re in ORGANIZATION! We celebrated crossing into the last state with way too much beer, and ORGANIZATION, in his inebriated condition, forgot to pack up his food. Well wouldn’t you know, around 1 in the morning, I started hearing this huffing and rustling, and I thought maybe it was NAME getting sick, so I ran out of my tent to check on him and came nose to nose with the ugliest black bear I’ve ever seen. It was missing one ear and had a ragged scar across his eye.
I froze, panicking—what was I supposed to do again? Run? Play dead? Scream? I just knew I was about to be mauled to death, when suddenly Aunt NAME stepped down from the shelter, walked up to that bear with his chest puffed out, and started yodeling. Yes. Yodeling. Deep, reverberating, melodic howls. I’d never heard anything like it in my life, and that bear must have thoroughly hated it, because it took off.
I slept like a rock knowing that ugly bear was off telling all his friends about the terrible yodeling monster I call Aunt NAME.
Mile 2178
DATE, we hike Mount Katahdin—the last leg of the Appalachian trail!!
Mile 2191
It was a grueling trek up 4,000 feet of rocky elevation, but I made it.
I MADE IT!!
There’s a picture of me, Melons, NAME, and NAME, our arms outstretched at the big wooden “Mount Katahdin” sign, and I’ve never seen such a wide smile on my face.
I looked confident—free.
The four of us lingered at the top for a while, reveling in our victory, then the others left me alone:
So you and I could have a few moments to ourselves.
And that’s when I set you free.
I lifted the cap on the small, cylindrical urn I’d carried with me through sunshine and rain for the past 2000 miles, and I sprinkled your ashes into the wind. You spread your wings and flew over the mountain, settling yourself in the rocks and rivers and valleys of beautiful, wild ORGANIZATION.
We’re thru hikers now, you and me.
And I couldn’t have done it without you.

91,"Patient report of recent symptoms/behaviors: (R/T DX & TX Plan)
NAME denied any suicidal ideation in DATE. She reported that she still feels sad
most of the time. She got an “F” on another math test DATE. She expressed
frustration with math. She was tearful as she talked about feeling dumb and feeling like
she will never understand it. However, she reported that when she got the “F” her father
was more understanding, did not lecture her or ground her further.
Session Note: (include therapist clinical intervention & patient response)
This session focused on Treatment Plan Problem 1, Goals 2 (adding an extracurricular
activity) and 4 (learn coping skills and emotional regulation). We discussed her recent
participation in a church youth group service day at ORGANIZATION. This writer
encouraged NAME to share some of her interests in order to identify additional activities she
could become involved in. NAME’s affect brightened as she discussed playing basketball
when she lived in ORGANIZATION. NAME was encouraged to find out from her school what she
would need to do to play basketball here. She is to report on this in the next session.
 Most of this session focused on beginning to assess NAME’s abilities to label,
modulate, appropriately express and cope with feelings. NAME was asked to brainstorm all
the names of feelings she can. She listed 26 feelings. NAME then was asked to share
times she had experienced the feelings. This activity assesses how aware NAME is of her
feelings and works on being able to verbalize feelings to others. NAME indicated that she
does not like to talk about her feelings. She was reluctant to talk about times she felt
negative feelings, such as guilty, lonely, overwhelmed, disappointed and unloved. We
explored why it is hard for her to share feelings. She indicated that it is hard for her to
trust others and she doesn’t feel like people understand. We explored ways she
currently uses to express feelings. NAME indicated that she likes to write, especially poetry. 
NAME was given a handout listing 50 feeling names to help her learn to differentiate and
accurately label feelings. She was given the homework assignment of writing a poem
about any feeling she has DATE and bringing it to her to the next individual therapy
session.
Patient progress towards treatment plan goal(s):
NAME reported that her father responded in a more understanding way when she recently
got another “F” on a math test (Problem 2, Goal 3).
NAME began to work on emotional regulation. (Problem 1, Goal 4). She can identify many
of her feelings, but is reluctant to share negative feelings with others. This goal still
needs quite a bit of work. "

96,"The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of DATE; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. 
The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o’clock; 
in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took DATE and had to be started on DATE, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took only about two hours, so it could begin at ten o’clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.

The children assembled first, of course. 
School was recently over for DATE, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. 
NAME had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; 
NAME and NAME and NAME—the villagers pronounced this name “Dellacroy”—eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. 
The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.

Soon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. 
They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. 
They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. 
NAME ducked under his mother’s grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and NAME came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.

The lottery was conducted—as were the square dances, the teen-age club, the DATE program—by Mr. NAME, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. 
He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, “Little DATE, folks.” 
The postmaster, Mr. NAME, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool was put in the center of the square and Mr. NAME set the black box down on it. 
The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool, and when Mr. NAME said, “Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?,” there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. NAME and his oldest son, NAME, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. NAME stirred up the papers inside it.

The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before ORGANIZATION, the oldest man in town, was born. 
Mr. NAME spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. 
There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. 
DATE, after the lottery, Mr. NAME began talking again about a new box, but DATE the subject was allowed to fade off without anything’s being done. 
The black box grew shabbier DATE; by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.

Mr. NAME and his oldest son, NAME, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. NAME had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. 
Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. NAME had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. 
Chips of wood, Mr. NAME had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. 
The night before the lottery, Mr. NAME and Mr. NAME made up the slips of paper and put them into the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. NAME’ coal company and locked up until Mr. NAME was ready to take it to the square next morning. 
The rest of DATE, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent DATE in Mr. NAME’ barn and DATE underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the NAME grocery and left there.

There was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. NAME declared the lottery open. 
There were the lists to make up—of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. 
There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. NAME by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly DATE; 
some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but DATE and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. 
There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. 
Mr. NAME was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. NAME and the NAME."
