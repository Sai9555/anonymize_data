Patient: John Doe
Progress Note:

Patient is a 25-year-old male who presents with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Today was his first session with me. 
John reports feeling overwhelmed with stress from work and relationship issues. 
He reports difficulty sleeping and feeling hopeless about his future. 
He reports feeling sad for the past two weeks.

During the session, John and I discussed different coping strategies for managing his stress and anxiety, including exercise, mindfulness, and therapy.
I also provided him with some educational resources on depression and anxiety. He was receptive to the information and is eager to start implementing the strategies.

I will continue to work with John on developing healthy coping skills and addressing his depression and anxiety symptoms. 
We have scheduled another session for next week.

Assessment: Depressive disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Plan: Continue therapy, provide educational resources, and develop healthy coping skills.

Jane Smith, LCSW
