For an instant Poke was abashed. “Why—why, there’s something in that. I guess I wasn’t thinking of our new name.”

“Well, NAME was,” said the Shark crisply.

“Huh!” grunted Poke. He glanced thoughtfully at NAME; seemed to be about to continue; changed his mind, and let the subject drop.

NAME went home that afternoon to find Lon in uncommonly bad humor. Somebody, it appeared, had opened a faucet in the barn, and left the water running in a merry stream. As a result, half the floor had been flooded, and annoying, if not heavy, damage had been caused. Lacking evidence to the contrary, NAME was disposed to hold NAME responsible.

“But I had nothing to do with it,” the boy explained. “I don’t know how it happened.”

“Foolin’ ’round here, wasn’t you, after school?”

“Yes—but I didn’t touch the faucet.”

“Guess you’re gettin’ absent-minded.”

NAME reddened wrathfully, but kept his head. Very clearly he realized that he had a deal at stake. A youth on probation, as he was, must shun rages as well as keep his record clean.

“Look here, Lon!” he said. “I’m not joking—I’m in earnest. And I tell you I’m not to blame. I mean it—honor bright!”

Lon rubbed his chin. “I swan, but it plumb beats my time! You’re sure you didn’t do it, and I’ll swear I ain’t been walkin’ in my sleep and cuttin’ up didoes for more’n a year. Yet here was the water goin’ like all possessed! Now, who set it goin’?”

“I didn’t,” said NAME decidedly.

“Hanged if I believe you did!” Lon had been studying the boy keenly. “You’ve got as much of Old Nick in you as the next ’un, generally, but you have been NAME’ pretty[131] well lately. And you ain’t a liar any time. So it looks as if we’d got to add this to the list o’ mysteries, ’long with who struck NAME. Only I do wish I could lay hands on the skunk that made all this mess, and argy with him a while on the error of his ways.” And NAME frowned as he turned his gaze to the water-soaked planks.
