"The cook ran back to the kitchen for a fresh supply; but, luckily, the hired man, sighting the chain extending from Step’s wrist, laid hold upon it, and tugged with all his strength, and the dog, recognizing his voice, changed tactics, and charged from under the porch, bounding over the prostrate Step so swiftly that he turned a complete somersault, when the chain tautened again. The old lantern, still smoking voluminously, fell between boy and dog."

“Jee-rusalem!” gasped the hired man in bewilderment.

"“Sa-sakes alive!” quavered the cook, who had reappeared with a freshly filled bucket."

"Poke began to laugh hysterically; but Sam kept his wits. He caught the bucket from the woman’s hand, and plunged the lantern into the water. There was a long, hissing sound, a final puff of steam—and then comparative peace."

"Step sat up. The dog, trembling like a leaf and whining weakly, crawled to the[121] hired man. From the vantage ground of the porch the cook spoke wonderingly and reprovingly:"

"“Well, I vum, but you boys do beat my time! What on earth do you think you’re up to? Playin’ horse with poor Hector there?”"

“No—not a bit; ’twasn’t that at all!” protested Step.

The cook sniffed. “Feathers—burnin’ feathers! I can tell ’em every time! But what’s your notion in puttin’ ’em in that thing?” And she pointed at the ancient lantern.

"Step got upon his feet. He fumbled at the chain at his wrist; and, by an irony of fate, the old catch now gave at a touch. Step rubbed the flesh into which the links had sunk. He tried to summon a propitiating smile."

"“Oh, the feathers?” he said very mildly. “Oh, yes; the feathers. Why—why, we—we thought Hector there—he—well, he ought to know about ’em.”"

“Land o’ love! but the boy’s crazy!”

"The hired man scratched his head. “Must say it looks like it, Katy. Still, I dunno—boys’ll[122] be boys. And this young man acted ’sif he was willin’ to learn same time Hector did. They were sharin’, and sharin’ alike, on the smudge-pot, te he!”"

"Step scowled, but Poke burst into a roar of laughter, which eased the situation. The cook chuckled; Sam smiled. The hired man smote his thigh with his hand."

“Gee-whillikens! but I never saw the like of it! And I guess no great harm’s done. Don’t seem to be no fire under the porch.”

"Then Poke found tongue. “It’s this way: The dog stole a chicken, and got us into a scrape. We thought we’d—er—er—we’d teach him a lesson and sicken him of stealing. And feathers and chickens go together—and—er—er—get the idea, don’t you?”"

"“Sorter!” grinned the hired man. “Kind o’ think I do, sonny. And t’other fellow got tangled up, somehow. Wal, yes, I do see how ’twas.”"

"“Then, if you don’t mind, we’ll be going home.”"

"The hired man waved his hand. “I would, if I was you,” he said. “I’d go home and get into some dry clothes.”"

"The three friends moved down the drive, with Step, a truly disconsolate and melancholy figure between the other two. For a little none of them spoke. It was left to Poke to break the silence with one of his bits of philosophy."

"“You’ve got to live to learn,” quoth he. “Now, who’d have thought—no use, though, crying over spilt milk! And what on earth made Step want to chain himself up—no; we won’t talk about that, either. But I say, Sam, I tell you there’s a lot of sense in that notion of yours! Safety First for me after this—yes, sir; Safety First every time!”"
