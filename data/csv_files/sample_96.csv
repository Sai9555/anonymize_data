"Directly in front of him a lively game of hockey was in progress. To the right, and safely removed from the rushes of the players, were boys and girls, skating singly, or in[166] pairs, or in long lines, hand in hand. To the left, near the dam, were a few youngsters."

"Sam shook his head as he observed them. The ice always was thinner there than in other parts of the pond, and there was seldom a season in which somebody did not regret rashness in straying too close to air-holes. At a time like this there was more or less danger anywhere in the neighborhood of the dam."

"“It ought to be roped off,” he told himself; but as there appeared to be no means to carry out this precaution he sat down on the bank and began to put on his skates. This he did leisurely, pausing now and then to run his glance over the skaters. At a little distance up the shore some of the larger boys were building a fire, and were having trouble, their fuel consisting chiefly of long boards torn from an abandoned ice-house. Here a little crowd clustered. Sam thought he had a glimpse of Orkney, but was not certain. As he tightened his last strap, however, and stood up, Step came along, arms and legs flying in an effort to recover the partly lost art of the Dutch roll. At sight of Sam the lanky youth went through some extraordinary contortions,[167] checked his speed, and glided alongside his friend."

“Say! It’s all right—he’s here!” was his greeting.

"“Who’s here?” asked Sam, quite unnecessarily."

“Humph! Who you s’pose? Deacon Pender?”

"“No,” said Sam coolly. “I don’t imagine you were thinking of the deacon.”"

“You bet I wasn’t!” rapped Step. “I was thinking of Tom Orkney.”

"Sam peered at the crowd by the fire. “Queer I can’t make him out,” he remarked."

“He’s down at the lower end—along with those kids.”

“Oh!”

"Step was grinning. “Oh, he tried to butt into the hockey game, but the fellows gave him the cold shoulder. So he had to flock by himself till he saw the young ’uns. He’s with ’em now, teasing and tormenting ’em, I reckon.”"

"Sam struck out with the experimental feeling of one on runners for the first time in[168] months; made a wide circle, and came back to Step."

"“Bit rusty, but I’ll get the swing all right in an hour or so,” he reported."

"Step brought him back to the previous question, so to speak."

"“What do you want? Don’t mean to fight him on skates, do you?”"

"“Certainly not,” said Sam testily. “What put such a notion in your head?”"

"“Well, what are you here for?” demanded Step pointedly."

"“Don’t expect to have a fight before all this crowd, do you?”"

“Seems to me you’re getting awful fussy.”

"“I am, if ‘fussy’ consists in objecting to scrapping with half the town rubbering.”"

Step looked hurt. “Don’t you want anybody but yourself to ha
